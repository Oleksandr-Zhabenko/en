About the power of human being
				</h1>

<p class="paragraph">You now are looking at just one of about ten parts of the original work. It
contains much more in Ukranian, but now only the one part is translated here. Please, check the 
text several days later to see the full version, if it is available here in a few (hopefully!) days.</p>

<h2 class="header2">Verses to be spoken about</h2>
<p class="paragraph">“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear
falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither
by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for
it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair
white or black. But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is
from the evil one." (Matthew V, 33-37)</p>
<h2 class="header2">Comments to the verses</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Here the Lord Jesus Christ gives a clear answer to the question of what power and authority a human being has by nature. Almost none. A person cannot even change a single hair by his or her word, by his or her desire, by his or her will, without interaction with the world around him or her, without God's permission, and if it is something truly good and above nature (a true miracle), then without God's will. A person can control their actions, their heart (and even here their correct guidance is possible only with God's participation, with His help), and they are responsible for this, but to control more is from God, and they can do this only with His permission or will. We can also see why it is wrong to attribute to people so-called "supernatural capabilities" - these are not their own. "'Greater than this' is not their power. And if it is not God's will that a person does something that is "greater than this", then it is from the evil one, a power of demons, impure, evil, devilish. Demons have angelic powers, because they are angels by nature, their powers exceed those of humans, but they are restrained by the action of God so as not to destroy God's creation and all of us. Nevertheless, God sometimes permits the influence of demons on people and the world, because they have a certain freedom. But we must not attribute the action of demons to humans, to think that these are human forces, "supernatural powers".</p>
<p class="paragraph">And if we look, for example, at "extrasensory" people (remembering that much of what the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5Ck5QSMiBk">media (not very authoritative, though, here,
the original link leads to Russian publication on YouTube)</a>
 spreads about them is "staged"), we see that they do not have true cognition. More about this is written in the work 
<a href="TrueCognition.html">On True and Speculative Knowledge.</a>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">One might ask: how did decay (corruption) and death entered the world through human sin? If they have so little power? We can simply say that the human heart, the human being became the "door", the "breach" through which sin, corruption and death entered the world. The human being has no power, but they "have opened the door". It can be said that although the power of the human being is by nature small, almost zero, he or she is honoured by God and is the pinnacle of God's creation. The significance of the human being is the image of God and is given to a person by God.</p>
