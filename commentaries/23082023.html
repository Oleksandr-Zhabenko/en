<p><reading>(2 Corinthians VI, 11-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VI:11  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’ -
‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VI, 12  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VI, 15  &ndash; ‘συμφωνησις’  &ndash; ‘symphonesis’  &ndash; ‘harmony,
agreement’ (hence the word ‘symphony’).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VI, 16  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘εμπεριπατησω’ -
‘emperipateso’  &ndash; ‘I will walk’. The quotation from the Old Testament is
composed of two passages  &ndash; Leviticus XXVI, 11-12, Ezekiel XXXVII,
26-27.</p>
<p>Just before that, Paul had written about the apostolic work. And here
he continues, saying that the hearts of the apostles are open and full
of love for the faithful, but the faithful sometimes lack the same
openness and love in return. They had to grow in this, just as children
grow. At that time it was not common to call the apostles <q>fathers</q> and
themselves <q>children</q> (a later Church tradition for clergy). In verse 13
of this volume, the translation <q>as children</q> can be either a comparison
or a direct statement that the Corinthians are the spiritual children of
the apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to say that believers should guard against sins and
idolatry, since they have been cleansed in baptism and adopted as God’s
children, they should live holy lives and God should live in them. See

<p><reading>(Mark I, 23-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark I, 24  &ndash; literally <q>what (is) to us and to You,
Jesus?</q> (i.e. <q>what do You have to do with us?</q>, <q>what commonality do we
have?</q>). The demon wants nothing to do with God, does not even want to
be in the same place together. An important point about demons and evil
spirits is that they want to be like God (hence the reason for their
falling away)… but without God, they want to <q>displace</q> Him, which is
impossible). ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘to us’. ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’. In a
parallel passage in Luke (Luke IV, 33-37), the demon asks, <q>Have you
come to destroy us?</q></p>
<p>See also the above reading from the Apostle.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the demon may not have known that the
Son of God was before him, but he could feel God’s power in Him.
Nevertheless, it is often understood that the demon’s words refer to the
knowledge that this is the Messiah, the Christ, promised by God. Demons
know the prophecies, they know about the Trinity, they can feel a lot
spiritually. But they do not know the hearts of people, they do not know
the future, and so on, that is, they are limited in their powers as
angels (although they are greater than people’s). If the demon really
knew that this was the Messiah, then he could think that this was the
Son of God, God, but he could still not know it (in other words, he
could guess, but not be sure).</p>
<p>It is believed that Christ forbade him to speak so that people’s
faith would not be based on demonic revelations  &ndash; because what is
revealed by demons (evil ones) is not revealed by God, it is not
Revelation in its proper sense, and although it may contain elements of
truth, just as half-truths or deception contain elements of truth, it is
generally misleading.</p>
