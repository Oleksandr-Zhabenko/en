Christ Is Born!<br>
🌞<br>
Let's glorify Him!
</p>
<p>
Merry Christmas Eve!
</p>
<p>
At the 1st hour: <br>
<reading>(Hebrews I, 1 &mdash; 12; Matthew I, 18 - 25) </reading><br>
Hebrews I, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς προφήταις’ - ‘en tois prophetais’ - ‘in the prophets; with the prophets’. Both translations are possible, the first emphasising that the life of the prophets is a living sermon, and the second that God works through them, they do not hinder God from speaking to people, but make sure that God's words are preserved and received. ‘ἐν υἱῷ’ - ‘en hyio’ - ‘in the Son; with the Son’. The first option is more likely, since the Son speaks as well as the Father.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς μεγαλωσύνης ἐν ὑψηλοῖς’ - ‘en dexia tes megalosynes en hypselois’ - ‘at the right hand of the majesty in the highest’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 4 &mdash; ‘ὅσῳ διαφορώτερον παρ’ αὐτοὺς' - <q>hoso diaphoroteron par autous</q> - <q>how different to the proximity to theirs (names in deep comparison, juxtaposition)</q>. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the accusative, indicating a comparison, a juxtaposition, so it is implied how completely different the Scripture speaks of the Son of God in comparison to the angels, indicating that He is not a creation, but the Creator, God.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 5 &mdash; ‘εἰς πατέρα’ - ‘eis patera’ - ‘as the Father’. That is, ‘Whom will I be?’, similarly the following ‘εἰς υἱόν’ - ‘eis Hyion’ - ‘as the Son’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην’ - ‘eis ten oikoumenen’ - ‘into the Universe; into the inhabited world’. That is, when the Trinity is revealed to the world. It should be understood that angels do not know God by their nature, but by the gift of grace, through God's Revelation, similar to humans.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 8 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος’ - ‘eis ton aiona tou aionos’ - ‘forever and ever’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews I, 9 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τοὺς μετόχους’ - ‘para tous metokhous’ - ‘to the proximity to friends'. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the accusative and has a deep meaning - on the one hand, it indicates that the Son of God becomes close to creation, that is, the oil in the prophecy is associated with the body and soul of Jesus Christ, and on the other hand, there is a comparison and contrast, which again emphasises God's greatness and incomparability with creation.
