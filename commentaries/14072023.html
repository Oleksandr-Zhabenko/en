<p><reading>(1 Corinthians IV, 5–8) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IV, 6 — ‘εμαυτον’ — ‘emauton’ —
‘myself’.</p>
<p>Paul says that when the Lord comes again, the hidden things will be
revealed, including the hearts of people, and that everyone will be
praised by God. This does not mean that everyone will be saved, but that
God will praise everyone. It is not clear whether this refers to
Christians only or to all people, but it is likely that it refers to
everyone (there are many Christians, and a large part of humanity at
least calls themselves Christians).</p>
<p>These words are also connected to recent readings in this way:

<p>Paul also explains how to think so that we do not fall into arrogance
and haughtiness in our minds. If we always remember that all good things
are from God, received from Him, and do not assign them to ourselves,
then this true and humble thought will protect us from arrogance.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XIII, 44–54) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XIII, 45 — ‘εμπορω’ — ‘emporo’ — ‘a
passenger on a ship, a merchant’.</p>
<p>Several short parables combined into one reading with explanations
and conversations with people. Here we see Jesus Christ precisely as a
Teacher.</p>
<p>The Lord shows by His own example what the principles of successful
learning are (not only in Christianity, but in general). One of them is
that the new is used together with the old, the known. And also the need
to combine the new (what is being studied, researched, learned) and the
old (what is already known). It should be noted that it is rarely
possible to achieve a good integration in everything — more often there
is a certain bias in one direction or another, which affects the
efficiency and effectiveness of learning.</p>
<p>The main meaning and issue of today’s parables is the value of the
Kingdom of God and the need to enter it.</p>
<p>If a person recognises this value, he or she becomes determined to
act in such a way as to enter it.</p>
<p>But not everyone has this determination, and not everyone will
enter.</p>
<p>Jesus also shows that the New Testament continues the Old Testament,
particularly in parables.</p>
<p>To the silverless men Cosmas and Damian:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XII, 27 –
XIII, 8; Matthew X, 1, 5-8) </reading><br>
 1 Corinthians XIII, 2 – ‘ειμι’ — ‘eimi’ —
(I) ‘am’. It is used for emphasis.</p>
<p>I wrote briefly earlier, and I quote:</p>
<p><q>The Apostle’s reading, which includes a significant portion of the
Apostle Paul’s famous ‘love hymn’, which many have heard without even
reading the Scriptures. This passage glorifies the work of the saints,
whose memory is commemorated today. But it is also important because it
shows how true love manifests itself. The apostle shows the significance
of the greatest virtue by comparing it to the spiritual achievements of
mankind. Having the gifts of the Holy Spirit, being even prophets and
miracle workers, ascetics and sacrificing themselves for a purpose, but
without love, a person has nothing to boast about. For only love
determines whether this spiritual wealth will be given to others, and
what a person will have as a gift.</p>
<p>The apostle goes on to describe love as <q>the union (unity) of
perfections and virtues</q> in their real manifestation. A person who has
tried to live according to this description for at least some time will
understand what he means. A few brief comments: <q>long-suffering</q> means
overcoming even great obstacles; <q>merciful</q> means sincere, true
kindness; <q>does not envy</q> means rejoicing with those who rejoice and
grieving with those who grieve, compassionate and sensitive, sociable;
<q>does not puff herself up, does not get puffed up</q> means modest and
humble; <q>does not behave impolitely</q> — virtuous; <q>does not seek her own</q>
— not selfish and not self-centred, partner and even sacrificial,
empathetic, unselfish, capable of perichoresis (a separate topic); <q>does
not rush to anger</q> — intelligent and prudent, tactful and accurate,
mature, <q>does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth</q>
— true, honest, open, sincere and straightforward, priceless as truth
for the mind; <q>bears all things, endures all things, hopes in all
things</q> — gives all possible strength and endurance, steadfastness,
courage and experience; <q>love never ceases</q> — will remain in
eternity</p>
<p>From the Gospel in connection with the feat of the free healers — a
commandment to the apostles; at the end of the passage is <q>as you have
received freely, so give freely</q>, which likens the work of these two
Saints to the work of the apostles.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
