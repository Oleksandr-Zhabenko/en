<p>Similar thoughts to the below reading in
particular, which is referred to in the Epistle to the Ephesians:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="28092023.html">28092023.html</a></p>
<p>Colossians I, 22  &ndash; literally <q>holy, blameless, and who cannot be
blamed</q>. These are certain degrees of holiness and closeness to God -
saints may have faults, but there are those who can hardly be blamed for
their faults, and there are those who really cannot be blamed for their
faults, for example, the Mother of God, the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XI, 9-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, with
which it has verses (9-10) in common, which can be found here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="24102023.html">24102023.html</a></p>
<p>The explanation that the Heavenly Father is kinder than any earthly
parent is eloquent.</p>
<p><q>â€¦being evil</q>  &ndash; not in the sense of being essentially evil (the
source of evil), not in the sense of being criminals or real scoundrels,
but in the sense of being evil, unkind, sinful, in a word. Christ sees
people trying to be good, but he also sees that they often fail.</p>
<p>If we compare it with the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew VII,
7-11), Luke has a difference from Matthew: Matthew writes about <q>gifts</q>,
while Luke writes about the <q>Holy Spirit</q> as a gift. Nevertheless, there
is no contradiction between the Evangelists, because the gift of the
Holy Spirit is also a gift that gives other gifts, and at the same time,
many gifts are received by a person with the participation of the Holy
Spirit. But there is a difference, and letâ€™s pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Luke, writing about the Holy Spirit, says this: <q>The Holy Spirit is
the most precious and greatest gift, for He is God Himself. And what can
be greater than God?</q> And if the Lord gives the greatest gift, the Holy
Spirit, then He will give with Him what is <q>added</q>. And if it pleases
God not to give something, but still give the Holy Spirit, then the
Latter is the Comforter, and in general it means that it is better in
such a way, and God knows that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you just ask for <q>gifts</q>, you may receive Godâ€™s
bounty, but you might not receive the riches of the Holy Spirit, because
He is a Personality who may not go where He is not welcome.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for many people, asking for specific gifts is more
understandable than asking for the gift of the Holy Spirit, so Matthew
is also correct in his interpretation of Christâ€™s words. We need to
remember them both in their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>To the martyrs Markian and Martyrius:<br>
<reading>(Ephesians IV, 7-13; Matthew X,
1-8) </reading><br>
 In the reading from the Apostle Paul quotes Psalm 67 (68), verse 19
(or in other translations, verse 18). This psalm is prophetic of the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ and His victory over evil, and its
beginning is very well known and is read as the Paschal Prayer.</p>
<p>It is an important reading, where Paul testifies that God gave gifts
to people so that the Church could be built up and the faithful could
become like Christ to the greatest possible extent  &ndash; like Christ Himself
in His maturity and ministry.</p>
<p>We can also say that through the gifts of the Holy Spirit, through
Christ Himself, through the love of the Father, the faithful can become
like the adult, mature Christ, be God-like in all their depths, just as
the full depth of the Saviourâ€™s ministry was revealed in His mature
age.</p>
