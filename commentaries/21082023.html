<p><reading>(2 Corinthians V, 10-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians V, 10, 14  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’ -
‘us’ (we). ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before, in the face of’.
‘φαυλον’  &ndash; ‘phaulon’  &ndash; ‘light, easy, careless, indifferent’ (evil as a
result of carelessness, negligence, inattention, indifference).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians V, 12  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; (on account of, for the
reason of) ‘us’.</p>
<p>Before that, Paul wrote about the resurrection of the dead, about the
body, so since the resurrection of the dead is the glory of Christians,
the apostles say that preaching about it  &ndash; whether in great astonishment
or in sobriety and logic, reasoning  &ndash; is equally glorious and has the
goal of the glory of God, the salvation of people, is the basis for the
praise of the faithful and, in particular, of the apostles
themselves.</p>
<p>And then Paul says that if Christ suffered and rose again for our
sake, then together with Christ we all died (to sin) in order to live in
renewal for God, for true life. He says the same thing in other places
in other words.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark I, 9-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>The weekday readings from the Gospel of Mark
begin.</p>
<p>Mark I, 9  &ndash; ‘ημεραις’  &ndash; ‘emerais’  &ndash; ‘to the days’.</p>
<p>Mark I, 13  &ndash; ‘ημερας’  &ndash; ‘emeras’  &ndash; ‘days’.</p>
<p>The story of John’s Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, His stay in the
desert and temptation by the devil, John’s imprisonment, and the
beginning of Jesus’ public preaching. Mark mostly writes briefly (which
is why his Gospel is the shortest). Often he testifies to the same
things as the other synoptics (Matthew and Luke), but sometimes he
provides unique information and more details. In particular, he says
that Jesus was with the beasts.</p>
<p>Matthew gives more details about the beginning of Jesus’ preaching,
in particular, he gives the prophecy of Isaiah, which was fulfilled.

<p>The words of Jesus in Mark are like a general introduction to Jesus’
sermon  &ndash; look at everything that is happening, do not be prejudiced, do
not be rooted in evil, repent, change and believe in the Gospel, in the
Good News about the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
