<p><reading>(Romans 11:13-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans 11:13  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is
used for emphasis.</p>
<p>Comparison of different communities of faithful and unfaithful people
to a fruitful olive tree or to other trees.</p>
<p>This is quite eloquent and expressive, but there is something to be
said about some of the details.</p>
<p><q>By nature</q>  &ndash; here <q>nature</q> means <q>physical origin</q>, i.e., tribe,
nation. The Gentiles were not Israelites (Israelites who became Gentiles
are not mentioned here) by physical origin, <q>by nature.</q> But now they
have become <q>the New Israel</q>  &ndash; not by fleshly origin, not as nations,
but by grace, through the gift of power to become children of God
according to Godâ€™s promise to all who believe in Christ. The <q>root</q> is
Christ Himself. And Christ will remain Himself without the converted
Gentiles, but the converted Gentiles will not remain such without
Christ.</p>
<p>Hence the need to <q>fear,</q> which is here synonymous with being
cautious and having a modest opinion of oneself to the extent of oneâ€™s
faith. It must be said that modesty in God is greater than praise among
people, for no one without God can <q>boast</q> of deification, but the
faithful, even if they were not glorified, if they achieve deification,
it is incomparably higher than human praise.</p>
<p>God is compared to a human being in the dimension of virtue  &ndash; being a
demanding leader and being kind at the same time. This is called
anthropomorphism and is a means of conveying something high in the form
of something understandable and ordinary. The word <q>strict</q> here should
be replaced with <q>demanding</q>. God is not actually <q>strict</q>, but
<q>demanding</q> (like any good leader).</p>
<p>What is clear here is that for God, people are both those who are
called to be His children by the gift of grace, but are also His
creation.</p>
