<p><reading>(Philippians IV, 4-9) </reading>
</p>
<p>The words of the apostle Paul about joy in
Christ, in God, about the pure and bright thoughts of the faithful who
fulfill God’s will. The Philippians were an example of faith and love,
therefore the apostle writes only about virtues and commands the
faithful to rejoice with pure joy.</p>
<p>As a source of meekness (humanity), Paul calls <q>the Lord is near</q>,
that is, remembering and realizing in life that the Lord is close to
people.</p>
<p>The simplest example that allows you to partially understand this is
to feel yourself in the presence of the Great and Glorious King and
Savior, God Himself. Will a person not magnify himself / herself in this
very feeling, or will he / she not want to glorify God, but will himself
/ herself not learn his / her humanity?</p>
<p>There is a good essay about clean at the link:

<p><reading>(John XII, 1-18) </reading>
</p>
<p>After the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus went north
to the city of Ephraim, and the Jewish elders conspired to kill Jesus
and Lazarus.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Entry into Jerusalem, Jesus came with the disciples
to Bethany, where Lazarus, Martha and Mary lived, and was with them at a
feast that they made (it actually happened on Lazarus’ Saturday). Here
Mary anointed His feet with myrrh and wiped them with her hair as a sign
of love and gratitude. See more about the anointing of Jesus by Mary at
the link:

<p>A few words about the Entry into Jerusalem  &ndash; a collective complex
quotation of the prophets from Zechariah IX, 9, Isaiah XXXV, 4, XL, 9,
Zephaniah III, 14. The content of the quotations, in addition to
prophesying about the events themselves, is that you should rejoice in
the Lord and His salvation, and not to fear them. The Lord is the
Glorious and Majestic King, but this glory and majesty is real joy for
the faithful, because they are invited, called, desired to it.</p>
<p>About the donkey is well written at the link:
