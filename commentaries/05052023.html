<p><p><author>Oleksandr Zhabenko</author></p><p> Christ Is Risen! ðŸŒž</p>
<p>(Acts VIII, 40 - IX, 19) This is a very rich passage about the
conversion of Saul and how he became the apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, I will focus only on a few important
points.</p>
<p>Acts IX, 1 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï€Î½ÎµÏ‰Î½â€™ - â€˜empneonâ€™ - from â€˜ÎµÎ½â€™ (â€˜intoâ€™) + â€˜Ï€Î½ÎµÏ‰â€™ (â€˜to
breatheâ€™) - â€˜breathed inâ€™. It can have two different meanings, both of
which are possible and tell us a lot about Saul (the future Apostle
Paul).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><q>â€˜Inhaledâ€™ - that is, was influenced by, absorbed from his
immediate environment. Saul was brought up as a zealot for Jewish
traditions and understanding (fanatical).</p></li>
<li><p><q>Breathed inside</q>, i.e.Â <q>lived</q> by it, it was the meaning of his
life and work, it inspired him to take action. In the parallel passages
where he himself speaks of these events (XXII, 3-21 and XXVI, 4-23),
Paul emphasises that he acted with great zeal and perseverance in his
mistake.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In verse XXVI, 11, the word â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¼Î±Î¹Î½Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚â€™ - â€˜emmainomenosâ€™ - derived
from â€˜ÎµÎ½â€™ + â€˜Î¼Î±Î¹Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹â€™ - is used, meaning â€˜was out of his mind with
rageâ€™, â€˜raging in angerâ€™, â€˜was furiousâ€™, and in both parallel
first-person narratives Paul is speaking for himself, Paul testifies in
both parallel first-person narratives that he acted <q>to punish the
offence of honour</q>, for reasons of honour (perhaps he believed that to
believe in the resurrection of the crucified Messiah was <q>a dishonour to
the Jews</q>).</p>
<p>But the Lord, by His manifestation and subsequent healing through the
Apostle Ananias, changed Saul so that he became the Apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Later, he always remembered his unconsciousness with repentance and
suffered much for Christ in constant labour and endurance, eventually
receiving the crown of martyrdom in Rome.</p>
<p>Acts IX, 5 - â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ - â€˜eimiâ€™ - (I) â€˜amâ€™.</p>
<p>A comparison of the parallel passages shows that Saulâ€™s companions in
Damascus were <q>partial</q> witnesses to the vision, although it is not
clear what they observed and what they did not perceive.</p>
<p>Through this partiality, Jesus shows Saul the limitations of
humanity, and in particular, of himself.</p>
<p>The dialogue between Ananias and Jesus in the vision is also
important. Ananias expresses his thoughts, but does not argue with
Christ. Christ, on the other hand, accepts human reasoning as natural
(as predictable) and does not rebuke Ananias. This reveals the purpose
of the revelation - not to rebuke Ananias for his human reasoning, but
to send him on a special task, a mission.</p>
<p>In the meeting between Ananias and Saul, I also note his trust in
God: <q>Behold, I am lostâ€¦ I am blindâ€¦ (You) lead me out, Lord!</q></p>
<p>(John VI, 48-54) John VI, 48, 51 - â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ - (I) <q>am</q> (used only when
emphasised).</p>
<p>The words <q>I amâ€¦</q> are not to be taken very literally. That is, it is
not a <q>definition</q> of Jesus. You cannot put an equal sign (=) between
Jesus and the <q>bread of life</q>. Just as you cannot put an equal sign
between Jesus and <q>the good shepherd</q>, <q>the door to the sheep</q>, <q>the
light to the world</q>, and so on. It is impossible, at least because the
Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself <q>contains in Himself</q> and
means more than any such image, He is Greater than them all.</p>
<p>But if a person wants to understand what this means, then we can give
the following comparison (imperfect and incomplete, but important) -
Jesus, as a kind of <q>super-lens</q>, <q>focuses</q> in Himself all that the Lord
wants to grant people and actually does grant them. Godâ€™s gifts to
people are extremely wealthy and diverse, and therefore one can see
<q>from different sides</q>, or <q>parts of the spectrum</q>, or <q>not all the
radiation</q>, but see a significant part. Depending on what we are talking
about, the images are appropriate. If we are talking about the Sacrament
of Communion, it is the <q>bread of life</q>. If itâ€™s about leading the way,
itâ€™s <q>the good shepherd</q>. If it is about importance and knowledge, it is
<q>light to the world</q>, etc. But this is not to say that these images are
completely lacking in literal meaning - for example, the <q>bread of life</q>
is closely related to the bread in the Sacrament of Communion; the <q>good
shepherd</q> is related to the way Christ leads people, and so on.</p>
<p>John VI, 52 - â€˜Î•Î¼Î±Ï‡Î¿Î½Ï„Î¿â€™ - from â€˜Î¼Î±Ï‡Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹â€™ - â€˜were engaged in battle,
fighting, arguing, quarrelingâ€™. Of the possible meanings, one of the
last two in the list just given seems most appropriate here, but the
first two are also possible. I note that the dispute arose not because
of the words of Jesus, but because of different Jewish human approaches
to their understanding - people had different visions of what these
words could mean, and so they argued with each other because the issue
was important. If people had understood nothing at all, they would not
have argued; and if they had understood everything correctly, they would
not have argued either. The dispute arose from a partial (and in general
wrong) understanding of Jesusâ€™ words.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the reading is directly related to the Sacrament of
the Holy Communion of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. A person who
does not receive communion does not <q>hold</q> eternal life in him or her,
in other words, cannot be entirely a saint. This does not yet mean that
he will perish in eternity. If the living part of a plant does not have
nourishment, it will decay (for example, dry up, fade) - and so a person
without Communion does not live a full spiritual life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Sacrament of Communion is very important.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
