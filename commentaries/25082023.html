<p>(2 Corinthians VII, 10-16) 2 Corinthians VII:10-11 - Paul lists the
states that often arise when dealing with emotions that lead to sin.
Many of these states are directly related to the fight against sin.
Therefore, their appearance in the Corinthians helped them to truly
repent. In addition to grief for sins, they also include zeal, the
desire for a worthy, dignified and honest justification, and emotions
related to fear (which are discussed in a good article here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a><br>
), strong desire, aspiration, determination.</p>
<p>He calls them <q>pure in deed</q> because the absence of such emotions in
the fight against sins indicates a degree of disingenuity, and therefore
a certain complicity in sins. If a person, when confronted with an
obvious sin, does not have any of the above, then they are susceptible
to a large extent to union with sin, to accepting it (and are <q>unclean,
impure in deed</q>, are not blameless, in other words, sin).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 12, 13, 14 - â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™ - â€˜emonâ€™ - â€˜usâ€™ (our, we).</p>
<p>Verse 12 - it means that Paul did not try to become a party to the
conflict, but tried to remain impartial, unbiased, critical.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to praise Titus and the Corinthians for their
encouragement and good treatment.</p>
<p>(Mark II, 18-22) Three short parables (images for reflection and
understanding) concerning fasting and the state of Christâ€™s disciples
when He is with them.</p>
<p>The meaning of the first comparison (with guests) is quite clear.</p>
<p>As for the patches and wineskins, the Lord means that there are
marked differences between the old attitude to godliness (ritualistic)
and the Gospel, so that it is impossible to <q>fit</q> both well. And since
the disciples are called to be renewed in Christ, in the New Testament,
Christ does not require of them anything that might even harm them in
this main point. This is also a good example for gradual learning to
live a new life with Christ: we need to prepare for renewal, not
<q>reformatting</q> the old. After all, true virtue is not a <q>reformatted</q>
old way of life that was not virtuous.</p>
<p>That is why Christ thus protects his disciples from the reproaches of
the Pharisees.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
