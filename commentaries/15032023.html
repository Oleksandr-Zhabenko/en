<p><reading>(Isaiah X, 12-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>Again, the Greek and Hebrew texts are different,
but close.</p>
<p>Isaiah prophesies that the Assyrian king, whose attack on Israel and
other countries the Lord allowed because of their sins, will not rise
above the nations and even more so above the Lord.</p>
<p><q>Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Or shall
the saw exalt itself against him who saws with it? As if a rod could
wield itself against those who lift it up, Or as if a staff could lift
up, as if it were not wood!</q> is the key question of the reading. Here
again it must be said that the Old Testament people did not distinguish
between God’s direct action and God’s permissiveness, when God does not
desire something, but permits the freedom of action to be carried out,
to stop other evils, to call for change and repentance, for other
similar reasons, etc.</p>
<p>About freedom, see the following links:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a><br>

<a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0rWaXRTkG2vABMLVeJKGEhvqLtp2bjC9MhCJ8usF4TqVJSNduWNsF7ZyLURqSbVxWl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>And here it is important that it is about the impossibility of
anything significant to happen without either the will of God (and then
it is good, really good), or without God’s permission (and then really
it is not good, but the Lord allows it due to the reasons mentioned
above) .</p>
<p>That is, the meaning of the question is that the Assyrian king (here,
specifically, but in fact, in general, anyone from creation) cannot do
anything exclusively <q>from himself / herself</q>, by his / her own strength
solely, unless the Lord permits it or wants it.</p>
<p>Someone will say: <q>If the Lord permits this or that, does it mean
that He Himself does it?</q> — but no, it’s not like that. More about that
at the links above. And also here below.</p>
<p>The Lord does only what He wills to do. It is impossible to force Him
or <q>include</q>, <q>draw</q> Him into anything, if He Himself did not want it.
God is never passive in this sense, He is always active. He can never be
a <q>victim</q> of manipulations of the evil type <q>here I will do evil, and
God will be guilty</q>  &ndash; no, but it is impossible to involve Him in such
manipulations, where He would be a <q>hostage</q>  &ndash; a <q>hostage</q> of anything,
and not would act completely freely, in His completely holistic freedom.
God acts actively and freely, only what He wills, and creation can act
like Him freely, if such freedom is foreseen and granted to it by God.
At the same time, the creation, not the Creator, is responsible for its
actions.</p>
<p>Isaiah X, 16  &ndash; <q>a flaming fire will be kindled in your glory</q>  &ndash; the
committed sin carries its own punishment, and the Lord will reveal this
punishment (here in the form of a flaming fire).</p>
<p>Many-meaningful words, as they refer to the present age, but
ultimately to the future age, the Kingdom of God, where sins will be
judged by God.</p>
<p>Verse 19  &ndash; <q>child</q> means one who has not reached the age of
adolescence, the original meaning of the word is boy, but it can also be
a girl.</p>
<p>Verse 20  &ndash; <q>those who wronged them</q>  &ndash; the Assyrians, whose military
and political support the Israelites sought, but fell victim to the
attack.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis VII, 6-9) </reading>
</p>
<p>Reading that Noah did according to God’s will, it
saved them all from the flood, including the animals.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear how many animals were in the ark, because
earlier in the text there was a difference as to how many animals should
be taken there. But it is said directly that Noah fulfilled God’s
will.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs IX, 12-18) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Greek and Hebrew texts differ, with
different manuscripts having additional verses.</p>
<p>But the main text about the <q>universality of wisdom</q>  &ndash; a wise person
is like that for everyone, as well as warnings against fornication. What
is important is that a promiscuous (or even adulterous) woman addresses
the same people to whom wisdom also addresses earlier in the text.</p>
<p>Therefore, this woman can be considered a generalized image of sin -
sin seeks to rule over a person in the same place where there should be
wisdom, where there should be the grace of God, where the Lord Himself
should be.</p>
<p>The Lord warns everyone against the rule of sin over people.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
