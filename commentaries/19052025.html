<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: John VIII, 44 — ‘υμεις εκ του πατρος του διαβολου εστε’ - ‘hymeis ek tou patros tou diabolou este’ - ‘you are from the father, the devil’.

 ‘απ αρχης’ — ‘ap arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the count - that is, the devil began to desire the death of people from the moment of their creation (‘from the beginning for people’). This is a clear indication of his fall before the creation of mankind. εν τη αληθεια ουκ εστηκεν’ - ‘en te aletheia ouk esteken’ - ‘in the truth he did not stand (did not persevere)’. It indicates that the devil was created as a good angel, like all other angels, but he became a devil, a wicked, evil one. οτι ουκ εστιν αληθεια εν αυτω’ - ‘hoti ouk estin aletheia en auto’ - ‘for there is no truth in him’. These are polysemous words. On the one hand, they indicate that he, as a hypostasis of the intelligent angelic nature, rejected all truth, becoming a deceiver, slanderer, enemy, etc. On the other hand, it indicates that the truth was in him before his fall. οταν λαλη το ψευδος εκ των ιδιων λαλει’ - ‘hotan lale to pseudos ek ton idion lalei’ - ‘when he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own'. These words continue the thought just commented on - and the preposition ‘ek’ indicates that he himself has become the source of lies, deceit, slander, enmity and the like.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts XII, 12-17) </reading><br>
Acts XII, 14 — ‘ἀπὸ τῆς χαρᾶς’ - ‘apo tes kharas’ - ‘out of joy; from joy’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that joy was not the real reason why she did not open the gate. The reason was different - it was her greater desire to share the news with those who were praying. She did not open the gate because she was more eager to tell others.
</p>
<p>
Acts XII, 17 — ‘ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς’ - ‘ek tes phylakes’ - ‘out of the prison’. From where. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates where the Lord led Peter out of. ‘εἰς ἕτερον τόπον’ - ‘eis heteron topon’ - ‘to another place’. Where to.

John VIII, 42 — ‘εκ του θεου’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God (the Father)’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates origin, and it is also used to describe the pre-eternal birth of the Son of God from the Father. ‘απ εμαυτου’ - ‘ap emautou’ - ‘from Myself'. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that it is something that can be seen as distinct from Christ, the Son of God, i.e. it refers to His actions in relation to creation, not to the Incarnation as such. See the following links for important explanations of this construction (especially the first and second):<br>

John VIII, 44 — ‘υμεις εκ του πατρος του διαβολου εστε’ - ‘hymeis ek tou patros tou diabolou este’ - ‘you are from the father, the devil’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates the origin of the intentions, actions, motives, and driving force of those Jews - they are from the evil one, from the devil. See more here:<br>

 ‘απ αρχης’ — ‘ap arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the count - that is, the devil began to desire the death of people from the moment of their creation (‘from the beginning for people’). This is a clear indication of his fall before the creation of mankind. ‘εν τη αληθεια ουκ εστηκεν’ - ‘en te aletheia ouk esteken’ - ‘in the truth he did not stand (did not persevere)’. It indicates that the devil was created as a good angel, like all other angels, but he became a devil, a wicked, evil one. ‘οτι ουκ εστιν αληθεια εν αυτω’ - ‘hoti ouk estin aletheia en auto’ - ‘for there is no truth in him’. These are polysemous words. On the one hand, they indicate that he, as a hypostasis of the intelligent angelic nature, rejected all truth, becoming a deceiver, slanderer, enemy, etc. On the other hand, it indicates that the truth was in him before his fall. ‘οταν λαλη το ψευδος εκ των ιδιων λαλει’ - ‘hotan lale to pseudos ek ton idion lalei’ - ‘when he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own'. These words continue the thought just commented on - and the preposition ‘ek’ indicates that he himself has become the source of lies, deceit, slander, enmity and the like.

John VIII, 46 — ‘τις εξ υμων’ - ‘tis ex hymon’ - ‘which of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates here that it refers to representatives of those Jews, but it can be understood in general - anyone, i.e. no one can rebuke Christ for sin, because He is truly sinless.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 47 — ‘εκ του θεου’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates the origin of works, life, thoughts, opinions, etc. - if all these things are from God, then the following is true of the person.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 51 — ‘εις τον αιωνα’ - ‘eis ton aiona’ - ‘for ever’. A common expression.
