<p>(Acts XVI, 35 - 41 (another possible numbering is XVII, 1)) Acts XVI,
39 - ‘παρεκαλεσαν’ - ‘parekalesan’ - ‘appealed to’ (here, in general,
the word is polysemic and can mean, among other things, ‘called near,
called out, comforted, consoled, soothed’, etc.) In the next verse (Acts
XVI, 40), the same word is used, where it already means <q>comforted,
rejoiced</q>. A kind of comparison is made between those who perform this
or that socially necessary activity and the apostles - the ministry of
the apostles consists primarily in the comfort of the Holy Spirit and
its spread.</p>
<p>See a good essay on this here:

<p>The events described were preceded by the imprisonment of Paul and
Silas (the apostle of 70, mentioned yesterday) because of the casting
out of a demon of prophecy from a Gentile woman. Also the miraculous
conversion of the prison guard and his house.</p>
<p>It must be said that Roman laws were not the same for different
social classes - some for Roman citizens, others for all other
inhabitants of the empire.</p>
<p>Paul and Silas were Roman citizens and could not be punished without
being proven guilty in court (the Roman Empire is sometimes considered
the first state governed by the rule of law in history, albeit with many
significant flaws).</p>
<p>(John X, 27 - 38) John X, 27 - ‘εμα’ - ‘ema’ - ‘My’ (sheep).</p>
<p>John X, 30 - ‘εν’ - ‘en’ - (We are) <q>the Ones</q> (this is an adjective
in the original) (from the concepts of <q>one, unity</q>).</p>
<p>John X, 32 - ‘εμε’ - ‘eme’ - ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John X, 34 - ‘γεγραμμενον’ - ‘gegrammenon’ - ‘written’.</p>
<p>John X, 35 - ‘εγενετο’ - ‘egeneto’ - ‘came into being, began to be,
became, arose’. That is, in fact, the Scripture calls those to whom God
spoke the word <q>gods</q>. Why is this so? First of all, God speaks to
intelligent beings, whom He has endowed with the fact that they are
hypostases of intelligent nature, which have eternal existence after
their appearance (humans and angels). In general, Christ quotes Psalm 81
(82), 6. The whole psalm is devoted to the fact that people are
described as <q>gods and sons (children) of the Most High</q>, but at the
same time are subject to sin and death as sinful and mortal people.
There is also a similar place where man is called <q>god</q> in the book of
Exodus: Exodus VII, 1. There, God makes Moses <q>god</q> to Pharaoh and Aaron
to be his prophet (the prophet of Moses as god). In relation to this
idea, St Basil the Great said that <q>people are gods who are taken
captive</q> (by sins, passions, and death). From this we can see why the
deification of human beings by grace, as theology speaks of, is
important (due to the depth of the topic and the lack of space, I will
not dwell on it in detail here).</p>
<p>John X, 36 - ‘ειμι’ - ‘eimi’ - (I) ‘am’. It is used only with
emphasis.</p>
<p>John X, 38 - ‘εμοι’ - ‘emoi’ - ‘I’.</p>
<p>(In reference to the Cross: 1 Corinthians I, 18 - 24. John XIX, 6 -
11, 13 - 20, 25 - 28, 30 - 35) 1 Corinthians I, 20 - ‘εμωρανεν’ -
‘emoranen’ - from ‘μωρος’ - ‘moros’ - ‘foolish; one who is inspirid,
lacking flavour; weak or tasteless; simpleton, gullible, naive’. That
is, human wisdom before God has <q>lost its taste</q>, people have become
<q>gullible</q> (believing in what is easy to believe). God’s faith is
different. See a good essay on this at the link (with an important
addition from 19.05.2023, i.e. yesterday):

<p>1 Corinthians I, 21, 23 - ‘μοριας’ (‘μοριαν’) - ‘morias’ (‘morian’) -
‘foolishness, absurdity’ - comes from the same word as above, but has no
additional meanings, unlike the main word.</p>
<p>John XIX, 10 - ‘Εμοι’ - ‘Emoi’ - ‘to Me’.</p>
<p>John XIX, 11 - ‘εμου’ - ‘emou’ - (over) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John XIX, 19 - ‘γεγραμμενον’ - ‘gegrammenon’ - ‘written’.</p>

<p>Since today we commemorate the appearance in the sky of the sign of
the Cross of the Lord in Jerusalem in 351, which had many witnesses, we
read the passages concerning the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
