<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Luke I, 15 — &amp;amp;#39;ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ&amp;amp;#39; - &amp;amp;#39;ek koilias metros autou&amp;amp;#39; - from his mother&amp;amp;#39;s womb. The preposition &amp;amp;#39;ek&amp;amp;#39; indicates here that this happened not at some moment after conception, but that this was always, that is, as far as can be understood — from the moment of appearance, from conception.

Such a outstanding trait of John is a foreshadowing of the Annunciation, but the Church also believes that the Virgin Mary has the Holy Spirit from conception (although this is not spoken of directly in the Gospels). Luke I, 17 — &amp;amp;#39;ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἡλεία&amp;amp;#39; - &amp;amp;#39;en pneumati kai dynamei Heleia&amp;amp;#39; - in the Spirit and power of Elijah. That is, he will have similar spiritual gifts to the prophet Elijah the Tishbite, who for his zeal was taken alive to the heavens (and therefore is not John). ἀπειθεῖς ἐν φρονήσει δικαίων&amp;amp;#39; - &amp;amp;#39;apeitheis en phronesei dikaion&amp;amp;#39; - the disobedient in the understanding of the righteous. That is, so that the disobedient might be converted through the understanding of the righteous, that is, so that those who were disobedient, hence, unfaithful, sinful, might become wise and righteous — this speaks of repentance."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
