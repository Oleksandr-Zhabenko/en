it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Colossians II, 1-7) </reading><br>
Colossians II, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ’ - ‘en Laodikia’ - ‘in Laodicea’. ‘ἐν σαρκί’ - ‘en sarki’ - ‘in the flesh’. In view of the following, see:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13112024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13112024.html</a><br>
we can think that the apostle is referring to his own fleshly weaknesses. ‘I contend for you in weaknesses, even for those who have not seen me’, is a way of emphasising this nuance.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἀγάπῃ’ - ‘en agape’ - ‘in love; with love’. Both translations are possible, the first emphasising that love embraces other virtues, and the second that it itself unites people. ‘εἰς πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως’ - ‘eis pan ploutos tes plerophorias tes syneseos’ - ‘for all the riches of full understanding’. Very eloquent high words. ‘εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν’ - ‘eis epignosin’ - ‘for cognition’. Here, in both cases, the preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in Whom; by Whom’. The first option is preferable because it emphasises that in getting to know Christ one discovers the riches of wisdom, while the second option implies that Christ Himself hid these treasures of knowledge, which raises additional questions, although it has parallels with the Father.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ’ - ‘en pithanologia’ - ‘in persuasive words; with persuasive words’. Both translations are possible, although the meaning is similar.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 5 &mdash; ‘εἰς Χριστὸν’ - ‘eis CHriston’ - ‘in Christ’. The preposition ‘eis’ emphasises that faith in Christ is and should be a movement towards Him.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 6, 7 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in Him; by Him’. Both translations are possible, although the first is easier to understand, and the second has parallels with Acts XVII, 28.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 7 &mdash; ‘ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ’ - ‘en eukharistia’ - ‘in thanksgiving; by thanksgiving’. Both translations are possible, the first emphasising that gratitude often includes other virtues, and the second that gratitude itself is wealth.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XVI, 15-18, XVII, 1-4) </reading><br>
Luke XVI, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἀνθρώποις’ - ‘en anthropois’ - ‘among people’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVI, 16 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τότε’ - ‘apo tote’ - ‘since then’. A common expression. ‘εἰς αὐτὴν’ - ‘eis auten’ - ‘into it’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVI, 18 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς’ - ‘apo andros’ - ‘from a man’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises divorce.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 2 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν’ - ‘eis ten thalassan’ - ‘into the sea’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 4 &mdash; ‘εἰς σὲ’ - ‘eis se’ - ‘’into you; against you‘’. The preposition ‘eis’ here may emphasise that the brother's sin ‘’affected‘’ you, but the second translation is clearer in meaning.
