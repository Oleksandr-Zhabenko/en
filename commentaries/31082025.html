it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written ‚Äî one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms ‚Äî or more rarely ‚Äî denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XV, 1-11) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XV, 1 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ ·æß' - 'en ho' - <q>in which</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 3 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ œÄœÅœéœÑŒøŒπœÇ' - 'en protois' - <q>first of all</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 6 ‚Äî '·ºêŒæ ·ΩßŒΩ' - 'ex hon' - <q>of whom</q>. The form of the preposition 'ek' before the next vowel indicates here a choice from a group of people, that is, it is spoken of representatives of witnesses who saw Christ Risen.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 10 ‚Äî 'Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºêŒº·Ω≤' - 'eis eme' - <q>for me</q>. The preposition 'eis' emphasises the fruits of grace for the apostle Paul and others.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the reading first of all concerns the continuation of the reading. If Christians did not keep the Gospel, faith as such, which they received, then they would not have true faith as such, and then untrue faith would not be worthy of that attitude which should be towards true faith in Christ.
</p>
<p>
Further Paul briefly reminds the Corinthians about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and His manifestations to the disciples. Many of the mentioned appearances are not described in the Gospels, therefore this testimony is important for understanding that Christ appeared more than is described in the Gospels, and these words complement the Gospels in this.
</p>
<p>
Some people try to deny the truth of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, relying on various assumptions for a possible explanation of events. But all these assumptions do not withstand criticism in view of all available evidence. Women and apostles, who did not expect the Resurrection, saw and communicated with Jesus. He ate food; Thomas, who wanted to be convinced, received confirmation; Jesus appeared in different circumstances, to different people, including those who were not ready and even hostile to Him (Paul himself was formerly a persecutor, but converted after a miraculous appearance of the Risen Jesus). People's conviction that the dead do not rise by themselves, here collided with the obvious fact of the Resurrection from the dead of Jesus Christ. A fact which the prophets, who were also witnesses of other miracles, prophesied about long before.
</p>
<p>
Further Paul speaks about the action of God's grace on himself, about his calling and subsequent work, cooperation with God's grace.
</p>
<p>
<q>to one born out of due time</q> ‚Äî in the times of the apostles there was no natal medicine in the modern form, therefore children who were born prematurely were smaller, weaker, and often sickly, with various disorders. Therefore Paul, humbly comparing himself with other witnesses, speaks of himself as if he yields to them.
</p>
<p>
<q>not I, but the grace‚Ä¶</q> ‚Äî here the conscious, purposeful and persistent work of Paul is not denied, but strengthening, direction, encouragement, giving, accomplishment, help, blessing and the like are emphasised, all that the Lord gave to Paul during his cooperation with grace.

<p>
<reading>(Matthew XIX, 16-26) </reading><br>
Matthew XIX, 17 ‚Äî 'Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ∂œâ·Ω¥ŒΩ' - 'eis ten zoen' - <q>into the life</q>. Where to. The preposition 'eis' emphasises <q>entrance, movement</q>.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIX, 21 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩŒø·øñœÇ' - 'en ouranois' - <q>in heavens</q>. More about treasures in heavens see at the links:<br>

<p>
Matthew XIX, 23, 24 ‚Äî 'Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ±ŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'eis ten basileian ton ouranon' - <q>into the Kingdom of Heaven</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIX, 26 ‚Äî 'œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒøŒπœÇ' - 'para anthropois' - <q>with people</q>. 'œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ Œ¥·Ω≤ Œ∏Œµ·ø∑' - 'para de theo' - <q>but with God</q>. The preposition 'para' is here with the dative case. Here the Lord indicates that one can distinguish life according to God's will as that which concerns closeness to God, from when a person does not live according to God's will ‚Äî like (many) people. More about what in the Gospels is often called <q>to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven / God</q>, see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The well-known story with the rich young man. It has many good explanations, I will stop only on some points.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the words that <q>No one is good except God</q> ‚Äî it is considered that Christ indirectly asks the young man about his faith in Him (<q>Do you believe that I am God?</q>).
</p>
<p>
I will begin in detail from the end. Jesus's answer to the disciples' question shows that the disciples, asking the question, did not understand the significance of God's grace in the matter of people's salvation. They thought that a person is saved‚Ä¶ by their righteousness. Moreover, in the Old Testament wealth is connected with righteousness, because the Lord blesses for fulfilling the commandments. But in reality righteousness itself, if it is true, has as its cause the action of God's grace, and the co-action of the person themselves in this. As it is written at the links above, God always begins First. He is <q>Alpha (Beginning) and Omega (End, Goal)</q>, as the Revelation of John the Theologian says.
</p>
<p>
A person cannot save himself by his own strength, salvation is always God's gift. I have written about this before, mainly when considering the Epistles of the apostle Paul, who writes much about it. Nevertheless, a person must accept this gift and cooperate with God in the matter of salvation. All things are possible with God.
</p>
<p>
The story with the young man shows part of the difficulties faced by the attempt to achieve salvation by one's own strength. The young man in the end found it difficult to decide whether he needed to follow Christ. And he went away sorrowful.
</p>
<p>
I wrote earlier that <q>the young man trusted in riches</q> (this is spoken of in a parallel place in another evangelist). <q>To trust in something</q> here means to put this in the centre of one's life. Where the Lord Himself should be.
</p>
<p>
<q>To enter into the Kingdom of God</q> ‚Äî that is, already in this life to consciously live according to God's will and calling. <q>Cannot enter</q> ‚Äî does not have the strength, ability to live thus, which is clearly seen in the example of the young man.
</p>
<p>
And one more thing ‚Äî Christ called the young man to perfection through voluntary sacrificial poverty. The young man was excessively attached to wealth, therefore as a path to perfection Christ directly tells him to distribute his riches for the sake of heavenly treasure.
