<p>(Acts IV, 13-22) Acts IV, 13  - endash the word ‚ÄòœÄŒ±œÅœÅŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ‚Äô is used  - endash which
means <q>freedom, openness, especially in speech, boldness,
confidence,</q>all-out-spokenness‚Äù, frankness‚Äù. There is a good essay on
the difference between self-confidence and overconfidence at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="26042023.html">26042023.html</a><br> Also,
the words <q>unschooled</q> (<q>ignorant, illiterate</q>) and <q>ordinary</q> meaning
<q>unprofessional</q>. The Jews had nothing to object to, to argue with.
Their usual methods of discussion were not designed for such occasions,
so they individually began arguing among themselves about what to
do.</p>
<p>They decided to ban publicly (loudly, widely) preaching in the Name
of Jesus with threats.</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to make a remark  - endash if they succeeded, then the
meaning of the sign of the miracle would be almost completely lost,
because the meaning of the sign was to create a wide opportunity for
public preaching, and instead of benefiting many people, God‚Äôs miracle
would become a <q>private</q> benefit of the healed man.</p>
<p>But the apostles correctly recognized (confessed) that God should be
obeyed more than people in such cases. This does not mean that one
should consciously create conflicts and provoke them, but it does mean
that one should take care to fulfill God‚Äôs will and commands and not be
afraid of people.</p>
<p>Another interesting detail is that the Jews <q>cannot deny,</q> and the
apostles <q>cannot but preach.</q></p>
<p>Here we are talking about meaningful freedom and power  - endash not <q>in
principle</q>, but consciously. <q>In principle</q> the Jews could deny the
miracle (but people would recognize them as <q>blind</q> in that), and so did
the apostles ‚Äî in principle, they could <q>agree</q>, but they would lose the
courage of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And, of course, the will of God must prevail over human
considerations. What happened to the apostles.</p>

<p>(John V, 17-24) Quoting from:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0bJczpeguhHwCWojju1SkLAuAGWcAFhS8qJUdEuCu9eoVmqkgsxd34RSNxnoe9vZcl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0bJczpeguhHwCWojju1SkLAuAGWcAFhS8qJUdEuCu9eoVmqkgsxd34RSNxnoe9vZcl</a><br>
<q>Important in today‚Äôs readings is the use of the prepositions ŒµŒπœÇ -</q>to,
to (in the sense of the destination of the movement)‚Äù and ŒµŒΩ  - endash <q>in (in
the sense of location or time)</q>. Therefore, they are more accurately
translated as follows: <q>and to court (as a destination movement) does
not come, but has passed from death to (into, towards the destination
of) life</q>.</p>
<p>John V, 18  - endash in English you can translate part of the verse verbatim
(probably more poetical, see the Ukrainian version, too): ‚Äòalso Father
His own He was calling  - endash God equal Himself making to God.‚Äô</p>
<p>John V, 20  - endash <q>loves</q>  - endash ‚ÄòœÜŒπŒªŒµŒπ‚Äô  - endash emotional love, built on
commonality, similarity, which occurs in the family, between friends,
etc., which has a pronounced closeness (in classical Greek and science,
this word often has other meanings).</p>
<p>John V, 21  - endash <q>gives life</q>  - endash literally  - endash <q>creates life</q> (as just one
word)  - endash here in the sense of God‚Äôs action in creation, regarding the
life of creation.</p>
<p>The Last Judgment will be carried out by the Son of God, Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
