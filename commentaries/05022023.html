<p><reading>(2 Timothy III, 10-14) </reading>
</p>

<p>Paul's testimony about his friend and colleague Timothy was read from the ordinary Apostle.</p>
<p>2 Timothy III, 12  &ndash; <q>all who desire to live godly in Jesus Christ will be persecuted</q>  &ndash; the word translated as <q>persecuted</q> (Slavic <q>pushed</q>) in the original can mean <q>to be fled</q>, <q>pursued</q>, <q>persecuted (like criminals)</q> â€” that is, it is not necessarily about persecution for the faith with demands to renounce it (although this also happens), but about a general <q>attempt to draw the faithful into evil</q> in one way or another. The next verse <q>deceiving and being deceived</q> indicates the state of the spread of sin, and the state of people who, because of this spread, will cause suffering to the faithful.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XVIII, 10-14) </reading>
</p>

<p>The parable of the tax collector and the pharisee was read from the Gospel  &ndash; a continuation of yesterday's. Due to lack of space, I would like to draw attention to two things:</p>
<p>1) as all good people with a conscience testify, the tax collector arouses our sympathy, the desire for him to correct himself, on the other hand, the self-mindedness and self-centeredness of the pharisee repels us. As a result, the righteousness of the pharisee is <q>not enough</q> for the certainty of his salvation, which he has, just as he is in a deceptive position close to destruction. Instead, the tax collector has every chance to change himself and bring his life for the better, and to build a much deeper and better relationship with God. Recently, I wrote a good essay about the desire for primacy, which is available at the following link:</p>

<p>2) everyone returned <q>to his own house</q> â€” that is, they lived separately. If they lived together, it would be a constant temptation for the pharisee to condemn the tax collector, and for the latter one it would be a temptation to be disappointed in <q>pharisee piety</q> (almost an oxymoron in quotation marks), only formally correct behavior.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
