<p><reading>(2 Corinthians VI, 16  &ndash; VII, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VI, 16  &ndash; ‘ημεις’ -
‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘εμπεριπατησω’  &ndash; ‘emperipateso’  &ndash; ‘I will walk about to
the place’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 1  &ndash; ‘επιτελουντες’  &ndash; ‘epitelountes’  &ndash; ‘let us
complete, make perfect, accomplished’. ‘αγιωσυνην’  &ndash; ‘agiosynen’ -
‘holiness, state of holiness, state of sanctification’. The apostle Paul
means that there is holiness among the righteous of the Old Testament,
that they are holy, as are the prophets, but it is not accomplished, for
it is fulfilled only in Jesus Christ, the Lord and Saviour. And the
people of the New Testament are called to perfection, completeness, full
maturity, fulfilment in Christ. God has done and given everything
necessary for this. God’s promises  &ndash; because God promises.</p>
<p>Today’s reading is preceded by the one referred to in the link, in
particular verse 16, which is common to both:

<p>Today’s reading continues with the one referred to at the following
link, in particular verse 1 is common to both:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="24082023.html">24082023.html</a></p>
<p>The quote from the Old Testament is a composite one, similar words
appear in many places, including the Law, the prophets and the
historical books of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>It refers to the deification and holiness of people. The topic is
very deep, but I will focus on only two important points.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><q>I will be their God and they will be my people.</q> The faithful
become partakers with Jesus Christ, the Son of God, so God calls them
<q>His people</q>, <q>as if He were on the same level</q> with them, which is what
makes people extremely gifted and uplifted. And for the faithful, God is
God, which means that people can see how incomparably Higher God is than
creation. We can also say that the faithful humble themselves, and God
raises them up.</p></li>
<li><p><q>I will walk in them</q>  &ndash; in the Old Testament, <q>ways and paths</q>
are often synonymous with a way of life, general behaviour. Therefore,
we can see here that God will manifest Himself among the faithful by His
actions, granting them grace.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I would also add that about the fear of God is well written at the
following link:

<p><reading>(Luke VI, 31-36) </reading>
</p>
<p>Part of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount in Luke. In
particular, it refers to love for enemies and the so-called <q>golden rule
of morality</q>.</p>
<p>In short, <q>virtues must be active</q>.</p>
<p>There are good writings on love for enemies in the Sermon on the
Mount at the following links:
