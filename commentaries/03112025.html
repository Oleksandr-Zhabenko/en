it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Colossians II, 13-20) </reading><br>
Colossians II, 14 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ μέσου&#39; — &#39;ek tou mesou&#39; - <q>from the midst; from the middle</q>. Common expression. From where. Emphasises here that Christ conquered sins in human nature, as the One Who has this <q>midst</q>, that is, the state of existence of human nature. <q>Nailed to the cross</q> indicates here that the crucifixion also manifested this state with the greatest force.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 15 — &#39;ἐν παρρησίᾳ&#39; — &#39;en parresia&#39; - <q>in boldness; openly; all-expressedly; confidently</q>. Multivalent words. &#39;ἐν αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en auto&#39; - <q>in that; in Himself</q>. In some translations is not translated.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 16 — &#39;ἐν βρώσει&#39; — &#39;en brosei&#39; - <q>in food</q>. &#39;ἐν πόσει&#39; - &#39;en posei&#39; - <q>in drink; in drinking</q>. &#39;ἐν μέρει ἑορτῆς ἢ νουμηνίας ἢ σαββάτων&#39; - &#39;en merei heortes e noumenias e sabbaton&#39; - <q>regarding a feast, or new moon, or sabbath</q>. Enters into a common expression with the meaning <q>regarding</q>.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 18 — &#39;ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ&#39; — &#39;en tapeinophrosyne&#39; - <q>in humility; with humility</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first indicates that (imaginary) humility is manifested constantly, and the second, that it is the driving force of such actions. &#39;ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς&#39; - &#39;hypo tou noos tes sarkos&#39; - <q>by the mind of flesh</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with genitive case and indicates here the mediopassive voice of the participle <q>being puffed up</q>, that is, either <q>the mind of flesh</q> puffs up, or such a person is so strongly captivated by it that they themselves bring themselves into that state of being puffed up.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 19 — &#39;ἐξ οὗ&#39; — &#39;ex hou&#39; - <q>from Whom; out of Whom</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;hou&#39; indicates the Source of growth.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 20 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων&#39; — &#39;apo ton stoikheion&#39; - <q>from the elements</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises liberation from the elements of the world through dying with Christ. &#39;ἐν κόσμῳ&#39; - &#39;en kosmo&#39; - <q>in the world</q>. Indicates life in the world.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul exposes heresy which then began to spread among the Colossians. Nevertheless, he does this in general terms, which is why here it is unclear what specifically that heresy consisted of.
</p>
<p>
Paul says that the heresy spread excessive faith in the powers of angels, taught somehow to serve them, by which it elevated creation above the Creator, above Christ. Therefore Paul here shows that Christ is Higher than angels. Earlier he testified that Christ is the Son of God, the image of the Father, the Head of the Church. Christ Himself is at the centre of Revelation, and therefore also of the apostles&#39; preaching and the faithful&#39;s life.
</p>
<p>
Also Paul points to one of the main reasons why that heresy arose, and also why many others arise — through <q>puffing up of the mind</q>, more simply speaking, through pride. Many researchers consider that that heresy was similar to later Gnosticism, possibly one of the first known (recorded) varieties of it.
</p>
<p>
Specific verses of the reading remain not entirely clear, to a certain degree enigmatic, what specifically is meant.
</p>
<p>
<q>Principalities and powers</q> — angelic orders, separate representatives of which became demons. These very demons were put to shame by the sufferings on the cross of the Crucified Son of God, Who humbled Himself in contrast to those demons.
</p>
<p>
Also Paul again speaks of the ritual Law of Moses, and also of Gentiles beliefs, for also Gentiles celebrated new moons.
</p>
<p>
Therefore Paul again and again turns to Christ — in Him <q>are hidden all treasures of wisdom</q>.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke IX, 18-22) </reading><br>
Luke IX, 18 — &#39;ἐν τῷ εἶναι&#39; - &#39;en to einai&#39; - <q>in being; while being; when</q>. Common expression with the meaning of the second translation variant.
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 22 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ ἀρχιερέων καὶ γραμματέων&#39; - &#39;apo ton presbyteron kai arkhiereon kai grammateon&#39; - <q>from the elders, and from the chief priests, and from the scribes</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here emphasises that the elders reject entirely, completely, fully.
</p>
<p>
The apostles&#39; confession of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, expressed by the apostle Peter. Luke gives it more briefly than Matthew.
