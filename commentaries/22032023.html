<p>(Isaiah XXVI, 21 - XXVII, 9) The Greek text and the Hebrew, as well
as the translations of individual verses, differ significantly.</p>
<p>Generally a prophecy of God’s victory over the dragon (Leviathan, a
mythical sea monster) who represents the devil and evil.</p>
<p>At the time of the First Advent, it was partially fulfilled, in the
sense that the Lord defeated sin and gave this victory to people. at the
time of the Second Coming, the final victory and blessing of the
faithful in the Kingdom of God will take place.</p>
<p>(Genesis IX, 18 - X, 1) The story of Noah and his three sons.</p>
<p>An example of the harmfulness of widespread (careless) alcohol
consumption (not the only one in Scripture).</p>
<p>Noah sinned through carelessness and inexperience, and Ham sinned
because of his character. Therefore, Noah is not told about punishment,
although it is quite obvious that if he righteously spared even the
small less significant animals in the ark, then the difficult fate of
his son was, in fact, already a certain consequence of his sin and
brought to Noah a lot of sadness.</p>
<p>Ham’s sin received a common name in the Ukrainian language -
<q>хамство</q> (<q>khamstvo</q>) (boorishness, caddishness), a word that has a
wider meaning than the actual sin of Noah’s son, Ham. Ham sinned by not
showing due respect to his father (in fact, in a more general sense -
due respect to what should have such respect, for example, certain
values) and provoked his brothers to do the same.</p>
<p>Since in the Old Testament people only learned to repent and make
amends, Ham did not repent properly, therefore he has as a science for
everyone a prophecy about the difficulties with which his life and the
lives of his descendants will be connected. This is not Noah’s wish to
the <q>bad</q> son, but a word that it will be more difficult for Ham and the
descendants who will communicate with him to build a healthy society,
and therefore, in the course of history, they may well become more
dependent on other people, nations. Likewise, it is not <q>God’s wishes to
Ham and his descendants.</q> God does not want people to drift further and
further away from Him.</p>
<p>It must be said that one of the tasks of the Coming of Jesus Christ
is to <q>heal people from curses</q>, therefore <q>there will be no more
curses</q> in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Also, Christ Himself did not curse anyone, only once - a barren,
soulless, but living fig tree, which immediately withered as an example
of the power of faith and the authority of Jesus as King, as well as the
science of the necessity of the fruits of faith.</p>
<p>There is more about faith in the work at the link:

<p>It is also necessary to warn those who wish, seeing rudeness, to
resort to curses.</p>
<p>As already said, Noah did not want anything bad for his son, and this
was a prophecy about the consequences of his sin, and more generally -
an unrepentant hard character. Whereas modern people, if they resort to
curses, they almost always do it with a desire for evil.</p>
<p>The apostles Peter and Paul say: <q>You are called to inherit blessings
and not curses, therefore bless and not curse</q> (Romans XII, 14; 1 Peter
III, 9, collective quote).</p>
<p>Also, the apostle James writes that <q>sweet and bitter water cannot
flow from the same source</q> (James III, 8-12).</p>
<p>(Proverbs XII, 23 - XIII, 9) Again, the Greek and Hebrew texts
differ.</p>
<p>In general, mostly words about restraint in words, prudence, the
ability to keep secrets, as well as about hard work and the preference
of righteousness over wickedness.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
