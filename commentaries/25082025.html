it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

<reading>(2 Corinthians V, 10-15) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians V, 11 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς συνειδήσεσιν ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;en tais syneidesesin hymon&#39; - <q>in your consciences</q>. Where. Here the plural indicates that each person has their own conscience, which can differ (and often differs) from the conscience of another person.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians V, 12 — &#39;ἵνα ἔχητε πρὸς τοὺς ἐν προσώπῳ καυχωμένους καὶ μὴ ἐν καρδίᾳ&#39; - &#39;hina ekhete pros tous en prosopo kaukhomenous kai me en kardia&#39; - <q>so that (you) may have towards those who boast in face and not in heart; so that you may have in comparison with those who boast in face and not in heart; so that you may have against those who boast in face and not in heart</q>. Different translation variants are possible, since the preposition &#39;pros&#39; with accusative, as here, can have all these meanings and they are generally possible here. The possibility to glorify the apostles, and more generally — those faithful who have achieved certain successes in spiritual life, can be both as a way of preaching, can be both a reproach to those who care about external appearance and insufficiently care about the internal, can be both an appeal to other people around.

To the Apostle of the 70 Titus, Bishop of Crete:<br>
<reading>(Titus I, 1-4; II, 15-III, 3, 12-13, 15; Matthew V, 14-19) </reading><br>
Titus I, 3 — &#39;ἐν κηρύγματι&#39; - &#39;en kerygmati&#39; - <q>in preaching; with preaching</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first emphasises that it is spoken of Christ as the Word, and the second — about God&#39;s words, that is about the content and meaning of preaching.
</p>
<p>
Titus I, 4 — &#39;ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν&#39; - &#39;apo theou patros kai CHristou Iesou tou soteros hemon&#39; - <q>from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Saviour</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that mercy and peace are God&#39;s gifts to people.
</p>
<p>
Titus III, 3 — &#39;ἐν κακίᾳ καὶ φθόνῳ&#39; - &#39;en kakia kai phthono&#39; - <q>in malice and envy; by malice and envy</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first indicates that malice and envy (rather it is spoken of thoughts, but following them also deeds) were the usual state both of Saul, who became the apostle Paul, and, perhaps, of Titus himself, about which is not known generally, and the second indicates that people tried to live, spreading precisely malice and envy.
</p>
<p>
Titus III, 12 — &#39;εἰς Νικόπολιν&#39; - &#39;eis Nikopolin&#39; - <q>to Nicopolis</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Titus III, 15 — &#39;ἐν πίστει&#39; - &#39;en pistei&#39; - <q>in faith</q>. That is who have common Christ&#39;s faith and love.
