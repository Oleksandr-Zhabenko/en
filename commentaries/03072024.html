<p>
Romans IV, 16, 24, 25 &mdash; 'ἡμῶν' - 'emon' - 'us' (our). 
</p>
<p>
Romans IV, 17 &mdash; 'ζῳοποιοῦντος τοὺς νεκροὺς' - 'zoopoiountos tous vekrous' - ''makes alive those who are dead''. It means <q>moving, active life</q>, i.e. not mere existence as a living being, but full life. This word, whose cognate is included in the Creed in relation to the Holy Spirit, applies to all Three Hypostases of the Holy Trinity. It is important to note that the souls of the dead and their state are also to some extent <q>alive</q>, i.e. the dead exist as such before the resurrection, but do not have a full life. Abraham believed in the <q>full resurrection of the dead</q>, and so do we Christians. It should be noted that when speaking about the state of the dead before the resurrection, Christ says in the Gospel that they are also <q>actively alive in God</q> (this was not revealed to Abraham, but was revealed by Jesus Christ to the faithful ones - see, for example, Matthew XXII). This means that God continues to care for them, builds the history of their salvation, brings them closer and will eventually accomplish their resurrection from the dead. From the point of view of humans, this is an incomplete existence, but God cares for the dead as He cares for the living, so in His eyes they are <q>actively alive</q>, He remembers them, fulfils His promises, is in relationship with them, and does not refuse to call Himself their God if they were so in life. Therefore, the souls of the dead could intercede for the living even before the resurrection of the dead and the Redemption by Christ (think, for example, of the appearance of the soul of the prophet Jeremiah in the time of the Maccabees or the soul of Samuel, who announced God's will), the more so after the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Romans IV, 24 &mdash; 'ἡμᾶς' - 'emas' - 'us'.
