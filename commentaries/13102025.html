it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Philippians I, 1-7) </reading><br>
Philippians I, 1 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; - <q>in Christ Jesus</q>. In Whom. &#39;ἐν Φιλίπποις&#39; - &#39;en Philippois&#39; - <q>in Philippi</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 2 — &#39;ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;apo theou patros hemon kai kyriou Iesou CHristou&#39; - <q>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that grace and peace are God&#39;s gifts to people.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 4 — &#39;ἐν πάσῃ δεήσει&#39; - &#39;en pase deesei&#39; - <q>in every supplication</q>. That is, in diligent and persevering prayers, when a person makes greater efforts than usual in prayer.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 5 — &#39;εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον&#39; - &#39;eis to euangelion&#39; - <q>for the Gospel</q>. Here rather such a translation variant, since human good fellowship is called to become a <q>way</q> for the spreading of God&#39;s will, God&#39;s salvation, God&#39;s Good News, the Gospel (in the broad sense). &#39;ἀπὸ πρώτης ἡμέρας&#39; - &#39;apo protes hemeras&#39; - <q>from the first days</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here the beginning of counting time — the Philippians in fact became the first who accepted Christ from Paul&#39;s preaching on the European continent, hence the apostle Paul&#39;s reminder regarding their special providential role.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 6 — &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - &#39;en hymin&#39; - <q>in you</q>. Where, among whom.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te kardia&#39; - <q>in the heart</q>. Where. &#39;ἔν τε τοῖς δεσμοῖς&#39; - &#39;en te tois desmois&#39; - <q>both in the chains</q>. &#39;καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀπολογίᾳ&#39; - &#39;kai en te apologia&#39; - <q>and in the defence</q>. Here a whole phrase is divided into two parts, therefore such a translation.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of reading the Epistle of the apostle Paul to the Philippians. This community was a support for Paul&#39;s preaching in Europe, in Greece, and Paul writes the letter not on account of some difficulties for them, but for fellowship and sharing joy and encouragement.
</p>
<p>
The letter begins, as is characteristic of apostolic epistles, with greeting and praise. Also here is thanksgiving to God and to the Philippians for their support in everything and expression of faith that they will progress well on the path of life in Christ.
</p>

Luke IV, 37 — &#39;εἰς πάντα τόπον τῆς περιχώρου&#39; - &#39;eis panta topon tes perikhorou&#39; - <q>into every place of the surrounding region</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the spreading of information.
</p>
<p>
Luke IV, 38 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς συναγωγῆς&#39; - &#39;apo tes synagoges&#39; - <q>from the synagogue</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that Christ left that synagogue. &#39;εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν&#39; - &#39;eis ten oikian&#39; - <q>to the house</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke IV, 41 — &#39;ἀπὸ πολλῶν&#39; - &#39;apo pollon&#39; - <q>from many</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that demons came out completely, entirely, fully.
</p>
<p>
Luke IV, 42 — &#39;εἰς ἔρημον τόπον&#39; - &#39;eis eremon topon&#39; - <q>to a solitary place</q>. Where to. &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;ap auton&#39; - <q>from them</q>. Indicates that people did not want Christ to leave them.
</p>

Luke IV, 44 — &#39;εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς τῆς Γαλιλαίας&#39; - &#39;eis tas synagogas tes Galilaias&#39; - <q>in the synagogues of Galilee</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here preaching, the spreading of the Word of God.
