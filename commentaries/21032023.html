<p><reading>(Isaiah XXV, 1-9) </reading>
</p>
<p>The readings about the judgment of the various
nations are omitted, they are generally similar to that of Babylon,
Assyria, and the Philistines.</p>
<p>Instead, the continuation of the readings is about the hope of the
salvation of the faithful.</p>
<p>Meaningful prophecies, since the Lord will ultimately deliver His
faithful from all evil in the Kingdom of God, but also at the time of
the First Advent He defeated evil and bestowed it on the faithful.</p>
<p>By the <q>strong ones</q> who oppressed the faithful, one can understand
demons, sins, and in general all opposition to God, which rests on the
world.</p>
<p>And God’s salvation is also in the fact that the Lord will deliver
the faithful from the attackers, grant them victory over evil, and raise
up the faithful.</p>
<p>Isaiah XXV, 6  &ndash; prophecies about the Mysteries of the Church and
about the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis IX, 8-17) </reading>
</p>
<p>An important place that is not entirely clear.</p>
<p>The rainbow became a sign of God’s covenant with creation (primarily
with people), about which I also wrote yesterday at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="20032023.html">20032023.html</a></p>
<p>It is an interesting question if you know more about it from the
point of view of science.</p>
<p>See, for example, at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow">Rainbow</a></p>
<p>The fact is that the rainbow is visible when located not anywhere,
but at a certain angle to the place where light is refracted (where it
rains, simply put, and where the light rays fall), and to the light
source.</p>
<p><q>God will see the rainbow</q> is also a clear anthropomorphism, since He
sees and knows everything.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that God can make a <q>sign</q> whatever he
wants and whenever he wants.</p>
<p>The existence of the rainbow follows from the laws of physics, which,
probably, the Lord did not change in those times.</p>
<p>But He <q>marked</q> His Covenant with people with a rainbow. That is, he
<q>put</q> His new meaning in it. And taught it to people.</p>
<p>Here, an important point is an example of the fact that the solution
to something difficult and difficult can come, in particular, after the
appearance of a <q>new meaning</q>, a certain rethinking.</p>
<p>Rainbow teaches us to think and solve problems for the glory of
God.</p>
<p>I would like to draw attention to the fact that it should be used
with caution as a symbol, since, for example, in the modern world it is
also widely used in completely different meanings, in particular, as a
symbol of a community of people of a certain sexual orientation.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs XII, 8-22) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Greek and Hebrew texts differ markedly.</p>
<p>I will dwell only on the general meaning  &ndash; as before  &ndash; the
construction <q>thesis  &ndash; an example that confirms the thesis through
negation</q> serves as a double affirmation of the correctness of the
thought and an encouragement to righteousness and wisdom (more generally
- to virtues), as well as on one interesting verse.</p>
<p>Proverbs XII, 15  &ndash; <q>advice</q> can be perceived as <q>turning the road</q>,
that is, changing the direction of movement to the goal, and very often
a straight path leads to the goal better than the one with turns. Also,
don’t dismiss thoughts just because they’re <q>a little longer than you’d
like</q> or <q>a little more complicated.</q></p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXI, 12-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>Reading in honour of the holy 40 Sebastien Martyrs,
whose feast day is tomorrow.</p>
<p>Luke XXI, 19  &ndash; <q>because of your good (hopefully, to a certain extent,
perhaps even life-affirming) endurance (patience).</q></p>

<p><reading>(Hebrews XII, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>Also in honour of the holy 40 Sebastien
martyrs.</p>
<p>There are reflections on punishment and training at the link (where
there is a reading from Proverbs):
<br>
<a class="link2" href="02032023.html">02032023.html</a></p>
<p>Hebrews XII, 10  &ndash; more literally <q>(God) is for our</q>gathering
together, together” to share with us His holiness.” That is, God allows
people to do that (or even sends them) so that they are not
<q>indeterminate, uncollected, depraved</q>, etc., so that they do not have
an <q>internal unnecessary struggle of motives</q>.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XX, 1-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>The parable of the workers in the vineyard and the
reward (in honour of tomorrow’s feast of the 40 Martyrs of Sebastien).
It is read because among 40 courageous Christian confessors in Sevastia
there was one unsteady in faith. Seeing that he could save himself by
renouncing his faith in Christ, he rushed, but unexpectedly died. And
one of the soldiers who executed the trial of the confessors saw a
wonderful vision that 39 luminous crowns of the victors descended from
the sky on the remaining 39, but not on the one who renounced. Then the
watchman believed in Christ, and joined the 39, increasing their number
again to 40  &ndash; and as in the parable, along with all of them, he received
the same reward  &ndash; the martyr’s crown of victory.</p>
<p>In the parable, the denarius (paid for a day’s work) refers to the
salvation of a person  &ndash; even if someone converts to God not from the
very beginning, but the conversion is valid and sincere, then such a
person receives the same reward  &ndash; salvation from God. And there are no
<q>halves or quarters</q> of salvation, but only complete and complete
salvation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the parable does not deny that the faithful receive
greater glory for working for the Lord, as the Apostle Paul writes in
one of his epistles. Here we are talking only about the most significant
general gain  &ndash; complete salvation itself.</p>
<p>The verse of Matthew XX, 13 contains the word <q>agreed</q>  &ndash; συνεφωνησας
- from which the word <q>symphony</q> is derived.</p>
<p>Matthew XX, 15  &ndash; <q>wicked eye</q>  &ndash; in the original <q>evil, bad eye</q>. That
is, <q>Do you look at it badly?</q>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this parable is included in the Passover
Word of St. John the Chrysostom, which according to the Orthodox
tradition is read at the Easter holiday night service. There, the image
from the parable is very beautifully and eloquently used to attract
listeners to the general celebration of the Feast of All Saints, the
Bright Christ’s Resurrection.</p>
