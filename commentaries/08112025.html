it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews II, 2-10) </reading><br>
Hebrews II, 3 — &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων&#39; — &#39;hypo ton akousanton&#39; — <q>by those who heard.</q> The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; is here with the genitive, indicates the passive voice of the verb <q>was confirmed</q> and those by whom it was confirmed. &#39;εἰς ἡμᾶς&#39; — &#39;eis hemas&#39; — <q>for us; to us.</q> Both translation options are possible; the second indicates that this is God’s gift to the faithful.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 7, 9 — &#39;παρ’ ἀγγέλους&#39; — &#39;par angelous&#39; — <q>to the proximity with angels; alongside angels.</q> The preposition &#39;para&#39; in its form before the following vowel here with the accusative has the sense of juxtaposition, comparison.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 8 — &#39;ἐν τῷ γὰρ ὑποτάξαι&#39; — &#39;en to gar hypotaxai&#39; — <q>in the subjection; in the subordination.</q> When and in what.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 10 — &#39;εἰς δόξαν&#39; — &#39;eis doxan&#39; — <q>into glory; to glory.</q> The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates where the Lord has led His children to.

<reading>(Luke X, 16-21) </reading><br>
Luke X, 17 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου&#39; — &#39;en to onomati sou&#39; — <q>in Thy name; by Thy name.</q> Both translation options are possible. The first indicates both that demons submit for the sake of the Name — in fact, for the sake of the authority given by Christ and exercised through His Name — and that the disciples are to be Christ’s, to be <q>in the Name of Christ</q>; the second indicates the means by which the authority received from Christ is exercised by the disciples. See also the parallel in Matthew:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/03072025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/03072025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 18 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ&#39; — &#39;ek tou ouranou&#39; — <q>from the heaven.</q> The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates whence the devil’s fall occurred.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 20 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; — &#39;en touto&#39; — <q>in this; with this.</q> Both translation options are possible; the first points to the perception of authority over spirits as a state in which the disciples find themselves, while the second points to the object of joy, that which gladdens the disciples. &#39;ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς&#39; — &#39;en tois ouranois&#39; — <q>in the heavens; with the heavens.</q> Both options are possible; the first indicates that the Lord has granted glory to each apostle — and more generally to the disciples, both men and women — in the heavens; the second that the apostles and faithful disciples of Christ have an eternal, unfading significance, a heavenly glory they manifest to the world. The struggle with the evil one will cease in the Kingdom of God, but this glory will last forever.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 21 — &#39;Ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ&#39; — &#39;En aute te ora&#39; — <q>in that very hour; then.</q> A set phrase. &#39;ἐν τῷ πνεύματι&#39; — &#39;en to pneumati&#39; — <q>in the Spirit; with the Spirit.</q> Both options are possible; the first points more to abiding in the Spirit, while the second to the Father gladdening Jesus by the Holy Spirit. Here is an indication of the personal relations of the Father, the Son and the Spirit. &#39;ἀπὸ σοφῶν&#39; — &#39;apo sophon&#39; — <q>from the wise.</q> The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here indicates that those considered wise stayed aside and therefore did not receive from God what would have corresponded to people’s opinion of them.
