<reading>(1 Timothy V, 1-12) </reading><br>
The reading continues and has two verses in common with the reading &mdash; 11-12 - which I wrote about here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05122023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05122023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy V, 1 &mdash; 'παρακάλει' - 'parakalei' - 'comfort; entreat; admonish; ask'. Here, most likely, <q>entreat</q> (in the sense of the passage).
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy V, 5 &mdash; 'ἡμέρας' - 'emeras' - (of) 'day'.
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul teaches and reminds Timothy (as a bishop and apostle, his disciple) how to treat different people who need a certain special attitude (individual approach). One might think that to some extent these groups might be more sensitive to all that Paul is writing about, and so the reminder is appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
<q>Lists</q> &mdash; The church kept some kind of record as it helped those in constant need. Those who needed ongoing help (and elderly widows were often among them) were placed on lists. Paul teaches prudence in leadership.
</p>
<p>
He also teaches us to take care of our close ones, especially our relatives.
</p>
<p>
He also says that the desire to live in luxury, entertainment, and the like, frivolously, thoughtlessly, leads to spiritual death (conscience and consciousness suffer first). 
</p>
<p>
As in another place, Paul advises widows not to remarry (this is the apostle's advice), although it is permitted. For more on this, please refer to the following links:<br>
