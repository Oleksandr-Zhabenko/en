it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(James III, 11-IV, 6) </reading><br>
James III, 11 — &#39;ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς ὀπῆς&#39; - &#39;ek tes autes opes&#39; - <q>from one and the same place</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here that from which the water comes out.
</p>
<p>
James III, 13 — &#39;Τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν;&#39; - &#39;Tis sophos kai epistemon en hymin&#39; - <q>Who is wise and experienced in you? Who is wise and experienced amongst you?</q>. Where. &#39;δειξάτω ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν πραΰτητι σοφίας&#39; - &#39;deixato ek tes kales anastrophes erga autou en prayteti sophias&#39; - <q>let him show from the beautiful way of life (behaviour) his works in the meekness of wisdom; let him show from the beautiful conduct his works with the meekness of wisdom</q>. Further in the reading it is spoken precisely about such wisdom. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here that one does not need to <q>demonstrate</q> one&#39;s works, but one needs to live beautifully, to conduct oneself, and this will be manifested in due time.
</p>
<p>
James III, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;en te kardia hymon&#39; - <q>in your heart</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
James III, 18 — &#39;καρπὸς δὲ δικαιοσύνης ἐν εἰρήνῃ σπείρεται τοῖς ποιοῦσιν εἰρήνην&#39; - &#39;karpos de dikaiosynes en eirene speiretai tois poiousin eirenen&#39; - <q>the fruit of righteousness in peace is sown by those who make peace (by peacemakers)</q>. Words of multiple meanings, since it may be spoken about <q>the fruit of righteousness in peace</q>, and also about <q>in peace is sown by peacemakers</q>. One can say that here is the ideal of peaceful righteousness — to live righteously and peacefully. By <q>fruits</q> one can understand works, and also all the consequences of righteousness, and is sown — indicates that righteousness accomplished not only does not disappear, not only is preserved, but also leads to its multiplication for the person themselves, for others, but also amongst others.
</p>
<p>
James IV, 1 — &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - &#39;en hymin&#39; - <q>amongst you; amongst you</q>. &#39;ἐκ τῶν ἡδονῶν ὑμῶν τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;ek ton hedonon hymon ton strateuomenon en tois melesin hymon&#39; - <q>from your sensual pleasures (and lusts), that war in your members</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here what is the source of wars and quarrels.
</p>
<p>
James IV, 3 — &#39;ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητε&#39; - &#39;hina en tais hedonais hymon dapanestete&#39; - <q>that you may spend (waste) in your sensual pleasures (and lusts); that you may waste with your sensual pleasures (and lusts)</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the second indicates lusts as the cause of losses of the spiritual.
</p>
<p>
James IV, 5 — &#39;πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα ὃ κατῴκισεν ἐν ἡμῖν&#39; - &#39;pros phthonon epipothei to pneuma ho katokisen en hemin&#39; - <q>to envy strongly desires the spirit that dwells in us</q>. Here is a difficult-to-understand place, there is no direct quotation of such content in the Old Testament. It may be spoken about the Holy Spirit, or it may be about the spirit as a component of human nature, one of the manifestations of which is the striving (desire) for God. Evident, however, is that envy acts as if <q>an excess of desire</q>, as if a flood that inundates the banks. I wrote about this <q>flood</q> earlier. But less evident, but true, is that if a person avoids the <q>flood</q> of envy, the <q>flood</q> of desire for what is in others, then they are filled with their own life like a full-flowing good river. <q>Do you wish to be yourself? Do not desire that which is in others, do not envy</q>.
</p>
<p>
A saturated place. Due to lack of space I shall stop only on the words about envy and jealousy. I wrote earlier that the 10th commandment (amongst Roman Catholics these are two commandments 9 and 10) is called to become the path to Old Testament righteousness.
</p>
<p>
James IV, 5 — the word used and translated as <q>envy</q> is ambiguous, but evidently, envy is an excess of desire (a desire for that which cannot be obtained by desire, that is, it is impossible to <q>transfer</q> that which is in the neighbour into one&#39;s own life with full preservation of all connections and properties, an unrealisable desire, which binds and steals freedom and inner independence). The excess is similar to a river that has overflown its banks. Excess needs to be avoided, for it does not allow to preserve wisdom.
</p>
<p>
James IV, 4 — <q>becomes an enemy</q> — the world in sin opposes God, and whoever joins with it in this, also begins to oppose God (in vain!).
