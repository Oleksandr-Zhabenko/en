<p><reading>(Acts VIII, 5-17) </reading>
</p>
<p>Because of the persecution from the Jews, the
faithful began to spread the Good News to other places.</p>
<p>The story of the first deacons continues, now with Saint Philip.</p>
<p>His preaching in Samaria was successful because of miracles and
signs, so that even Simon the magician believed and was baptised.</p>
<p>The comparison of truth with illusions is illustrative here  &ndash; real
miracles turned even the former magician to faith.</p>
<p>Also important is the testimony about the baptism and laying on of
hands of the apostles, which in this case was the original form of the
Sacrament of Anointing.</p>
<p>The gift of the Holy Spirit was given to the baptised Samaritans only
after the laying on of hands of the apostles, that is, after the
original form of the Sacrament of Anointing.</p>

<p>Continuation of the reading, which was analysed
recently at the link:

<p>John VI, 33  &ndash; a double translation with different (but mutually
complementary) meanings is possible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><q>The bread of God is (the One) Who comes down from heaven and gives
life to the world.</q></li>
</ol>
<p>or:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><q>The bread of God is that one which comes down from heaven and gives
life to the world</q>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, both the <q>bread from heaven</q> and Christ Himself may be meant
by the name of the <q>Bread of Life</q>.</p>
<p>In the first version (1), Christ Himself is called <q>the Bread of God
from heaven</q>, while the second version (2) refers more to the bread in
the Sacrament of Communion (which will also be addressed later).</p>
<p>In general, the dialogue has many moments where the train of thought
<q>transitions</q>. Christ speaks of the search for bread that lasts into
eternal life, and peopleâ€¦ ask what they can do to do Godâ€™s workâ€¦ Christ
says that the first thing they need to do is to trust in God and to
believe in Himâ€¦ They ask for a sign that Christ is doing Godâ€™s works.
They remember Moses and the manna from heaven, and the Lord tells them
about the Father and about Himself and (the Bread) the bread of
life.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a lively, animated conversation, and the
Lord reveals the truth to the people to the extent of their
understanding.</p>
<p>Peopleâ€™s questions are generally reasonable as to what they should
do. But it must be said that Godâ€™s works are done by God Himself in
people, so the question is: <q>What should we do to do Godâ€™s works?</q>
actually means what should we do so that God does His works in us,
through us, and we, therefore, act together with Him in this (this
co-action is called <q>synergy</q>).</p>
<p>Jesus answers in a gradual way: first of all, they mustâ€¦ trust God
and to believe in the One He has sent, that is, in Jesus Himself.
Without this, they will not be able to really do Godâ€™s works (their life
path will go <q>wrong</q>).</p>
<p>People continue to think in earthly terms, but Jesus speaks of
spiritual things.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the miracle of the feeding of the multitudes gave Jesus
a good opportunity to reveal Godâ€™s will to the people and aroused great
interest and excitement in them.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
