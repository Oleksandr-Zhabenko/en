<p><reading>(1 Thessalonians I, 1-5) </reading>
</p>

<p>The beginning of the weekday readings from the 1 Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Thessalonians (inhabitants of the city of Thessalonica, modern Thessaloniki).</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians I, 2, 3, 5 — 'ἡμῶν' — 'emon' — 'us' ((in) ours, ours, ours).</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, begin the letter with a greeting and a wish, followed by thanksgiving, and encouragement to the Thessalonians in their endurance, faith, hope, and love. There is also evidence of the apostles' preaching in the Holy Spirit, as well as evidence of the courage of the Thessalonians.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XII, 13-15, 22-31) </reading>
</p>

<p>Luke XII, 13 — 'ἐμοῦ' — 'emou' — 'me' ((with) me).</p>

<p>The reading at the beginning is a unique tradition of Luke — Jesus does not arbitrate with the brothers about the inheritance. He goes on to teach how to treat the property so that the distribution is just and right. If the asker's brother had obeyed Jesus' words and had reason to share the property, he would have done so. But at the same time, the brother's request could have been motivated by a desire to gain <q>additional</q> property through Jesus' authority. In fact, it was an attempt to <q>drag</q> Jesus into a matter that was not God's will, so Jesus responds with a question and then a teaching.</p>

<p>The parable is omitted today, but the science itself goes on. I wrote more about the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew VI, 25-34) here:</p>
