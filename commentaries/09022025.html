it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(2 Timothy III, 10-15) </reading><br>
2 Timothy III, 10 &mdash; ‘παρηκολούθησάς μου τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ’ - ‘parekolouthesas mou te didaskalia’ - ‘followed the doctrine closely after me; followed my doctrine closely; followed me closely in doctrine’. There are various possible translations here, but the first one seems to be the most grammatically correct. The prefix ‘par’ is derived from the preposition ‘para’ and here the dative case is used for the words ‘doctrine’ and the following (indicating the meaning ‘to follow closely the doctrine and the following’, which are ‘mine’), while ‘mou’ is in the genitive case, indicating, on the one hand, possession. On the other hand, if ‘mou’ indicates possession, it is more often used after the words to which it refers, i.e., it is used at the end of a phrase, and here it is used at the beginning. If the apostle was referring to following himself, it would be grammatically more logical to use the pronoun in the dative case, but here it is used in the genitive. Since Paul himself followed his own teaching, it is possible that he used the compound phrase to simultaneously emphasise the diligent and successful following of both the teaching and Paul himself.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III, 11 &mdash; ‘ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ, ἐν Ἰκονίῳ, ἐν Λύστροις’ - ‘en Antiokheia, en Ikonio, en Lystrois’ - ‘in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra’. ‘ἐκ πάντων’ - ‘ek panton’ - ‘out of all'. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates a deliverance out of all persecution and oppression, i.e. ‘where from’.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III:12 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Christ Jesus’. 
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν οἷς’ - ‘en hois’ - ‘in those things, in that’.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III, 15 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ βρέφους’ - ‘apo brephous’ - ‘from birth; from the age of an infant’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the countdown. ‘εἰς σωτηρίαν’ - ‘eis soterian’ - ‘for salvation’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates a purpose, a destination. ‘πίστεως τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘pisteos tes en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘the faith, which is in Christ Jesus; the faith that is in Christ Jesus’. Both translations are possible.
