<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Matthew XIX, 5 — 'ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν' - 'esontai hoi duo eis sarka mian' - shall become the two one flesh; shall become two into one flesh. The preposition 'eis' indicates here what those people will become — a single whole. These important words are God's Mystery — for example, one can ask why precisely one flesh. Just in the verse before this it was spoken about will cleave (that is, the image of bodily union), and then it is spoken about flesh (which may be, or may not be a synonym for body). One can recall the conversation with the Sadducees, where Christ said that after the Resurrection people do not marry. I think, the body a person feels always (almost), but not everything that a person feels has bodily origin and source. The bodily is often such that one can most feel, verify, fix, touch (let us recall the apostle Thomas). That is, the unity of two in Marriage is not absolute, but is so essential that it cannot be neglected or arbitrarily disposed of. Matthew XIX, 12 — 'ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς ἐγεννήθησαν οὕτως' - 'ek koilias metros egennethesan houtos' - from mother's womb were born thus. The preposition 'ek' indicates here that they were such always, even before birth. εὐνουχίσθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων' - 'eunoukhisthesan hypo ton anthropon' - were made eunuchs by people. The preposition 'hypo' here with genitive case indicates here the passive state of the participle were made eunuchs. The word to receive (to give place, particularly as to a travelling person, to proceed, go forward) is polysemantic, its usage here indicates that a person to a certain extent has the possibility (possibly, not all) to receive either another person (marrying them), or celibacy in the Lord. Such receiving must give space, move forward, be received with love. In general the word is very polysemantic, to a certain extent, generally characterises the concept of value. Reflecting on the richness of its meanings I wrote a poem-wish (using it not in the sense of specifically this verse, but taking into account and trying to convey the depth of seeing the content of the word, because I wish the girl to whom it is dedicated, either to be married once in the Lord, or to preserve purity in Him), available at the link:

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<reading>(Matthew XIX, 3-12) </reading><br>
Matthew XIX, 4, 8 — 'ἀπ' ἀρχῆς' - 'ap arkhes' - <q>from the beginning</q>. Common expression. The preposition 'apo' in its form before the next vowel indicates here the starting point of time counting.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIX, 5 — 'ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν' - 'esontai hoi duo eis sarka mian' - <q>shall become the two one flesh; shall become two into one flesh</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here what those people will become — a single whole. These important words are God's Mystery — for example, one can ask why precisely <q>one flesh</q>. Just in the verse before this it was spoken about <q>will cleave</q> (that is, the image of bodily union), and then it is spoken about <q>flesh</q> (which may be, or may not be a synonym for <q>body</q>).
