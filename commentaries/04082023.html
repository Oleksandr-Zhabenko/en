<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XIV, 26-40) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, as
well as the earlier one:
<br><a class="link2" href="03082023.html">03082023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="27072023.html">27072023.html</a></p>
<p>Continuing what I wrote there in relation to todayâ€™s reading, I will
say that if understanding why God created man first is beyond human
understanding, then why Paul forbids women to preach (teach) in worship
can still be partially understood from the story of Eve and the
fall.</p>
<p>I wrote about this earlier. Paul refers to God and the devil (the
serpent) in his words, and from these two starting points he explains
why he says this. The devil seduced Eve because she was easier to tempt.
This explains the prohibition of women preaching in worship. When a man
preaches, he more or less clearly understands where he says something
<q>from himself</q>, whatever that means. A woman, on the other hand, may be
<q>gentler, more delicate,</q> and therefore it may be more difficult for her
to discern where she speaks <q>from herself.</q> And this latter, under
certain conditions and circumstances (and therefore, it must be taken
into account), will lead to the fact that a woman may <q>make certain
changes</q>. This affects the preservation of the faith, and so Paul
forbids it. In all other cases, however, there is no such
prohibition.</p>
<p>For example, a woman can write sermons because she can think clearly
in advance about what is needed; a woman can preach outside of the
service, there are even co-apostolic women, such as Mary Magdalene;
there are helpers of the apostles, such as Mary, the sister of the
Apostle Philip, there are enlighteners of entire nations, such as St
Nina, the enlightener of Georgia; there are Saintly women who taught the
Church Fathers, such as Saint Mokrina, the sister of Saint Gregory of
Nyssa, as he himself testified; and finally, there is the Mother of God,
Who also preached; the Scriptures mention women prophets, such as Anna
and others, and certainly do not prohibit anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Scripture even gives examples of when a male prophet needed to obey a
female donkey who spoke, as well as other examples, such as learning
from ants and bees.</p>
<p>I mentioned the <q>spirits of the prophets</q> in a good piece:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a></p>
<p><q>the commandment of the Lord</q>  &ndash; it is not clear what is meant
(whether it refers to Jesus or to the Old Testament, and whether it is a
commandment regarding the preaching of women or regarding the need to
understand what is being preached).</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXI, 12-14, 17-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>Christ shows His authority as King.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful prayer about the cave of the thieves: <q>Lord,
grant us that our hearts may be houses of fidelity and not caves of
thieves!</q></p>
<p>For an example of faith, see this link:

<p>Holy Mary Magdalene, the Myrrh-bearer, my beloved Saint woman: (1
Corinthians IX, 2-12; Luke VIII, 1-3) 1 Corinthians IX, 2  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ -
â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is used for emphasis.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IX, 3  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î·â€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™  &ndash; â€˜myâ€™ (defence). â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™ -
â€˜meâ€™.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IX:10  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IX, 11, 12  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emeisâ€™  &ndash; â€˜weâ€™.</p>
<p>The reading of the Apostle testifies to the apostolic dignity, in
particular to the authority, and also to the work of Paul, who was very
diligent, zealous, so as not to put any obstacles to the Gospel. There
is a continuation to the passage, about which I wrote here:
<br><a class="link2" href="24072023.html">24072023.html</a></p>
<p>The Gospel mentions Mary Magdalene, who was wealthy and could support
the ministry of Jesus and the apostles with her money and property. It
also mentions the exorcism of seven demons from her (i.e., her obsession
was severe). At the same time, both of these facts indicate that Mary
was probably not the forgiven sinner described in chapter 7. There is no
mention of demon obsession.</p>
<p>In general, it should be said that Mary Magdalene did not leave Jesus
during His Passion, became one of the first witnesses of the
Resurrection, the first preacher of the Resurrection, and according to
Tradition, it is from her that the custom of greeting Easter with
coloured eggs and saying <q>Christ Is Risen!</q> comes. I think, as I wrote
about earlier, she was not martyred because her martyrdom took place
during the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. All the faithful who did not
leave Jesus at that time peacefully passed away to the Lord (see:
Revelation III, 10; John XXI, 15-25).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
