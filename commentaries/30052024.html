Acts x, 39 &mdash; ‘ἡμεῖς’ - ‘emeis’ - ‘we’.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 40 &mdash; ‘ἡμέρᾳ’ - ‘emera’ - ‘day’.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 41, 42 &mdash; ἡμῖν - emin - ‘us’. ‘διαμαρτύρασθαι’ - ‘diamortyrasthai’ - ‘solemnly testified; gave solemn, i.e., strong, evidence’.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 43 &mdash; ‘ὡρισμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ κριτὴς ζώντων καὶ νεκρῶν’ - ‘orismenos (h)ypo theou krites zonton kai nekron’ - ‘determined under God (from God; through God; by God) the Judge of the living and the dead’. Here, with the exception of the words about His Resurrection in verse 41, the whole passage speaks of Jesus in His human nature. God (here, as in most texts of the New Testament) is God the Father, and here He is called as the Beginning of the Godhead. It must be remembered that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is also God, consubstantial and equal in Godhead with the Father and the Holy Spirit. According to the Gospel of John, the Father ‘has given all judgement to the Son, because He is the Son of Man’ (John V, 18-24, 26-27), which does not mean that the Father has abandoned judgement and that the Son does not have the power to judge in the Godhead as God, no, the Father has not abandoned judgement and the Son has authority by the Godhead, but just as the Son is begotten of the Father from eternity, so also the Son has authority from the Father. The verse John V, 26 is important here, as it shows that, unlike God's gifts to creation, the Son receives from the Father essentially inseparably, irrevocably, and unchangeably everything that They have in common. In this way, the Son at the same time inexpressibly receives, and at the same time fully and completely, sovereignly, and self-existently possesses in Himself. It is impossible for it to be otherwise.
