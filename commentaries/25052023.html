<p><reading>(Acts I, 1-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts I, 7  &ndash; ‘εθετο’  &ndash; ‘etheto’  &ndash; ‘set, laid’ (in
passive or horizontal position). In other words, time and epochs do not
actively influence the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, only God actively
determined (set) that time. We can also say that we should not be
interested in the question of time in this sense at all  &ndash; time itself
has no influence on the Second Coming.</p>
<p>The story of the Ascension of Jesus Christ to heaven (heavens) from
the point of view of the apostles as earthly observers.</p>
<p>Luke, at the beginning of the book of Acts, addresses Theophilus,
believed to be a wealthy and educated Christian of Greek origin, a
friend of Luke. The first book is the Gospel of Luke, and the second is
Acts (some call Acts the <q>Gospel of the Holy Spirit</q> because it
describes how He acts in the Church). Luke, my beloved saint, is the
author of both of these books.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXIV, 36-53) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke XXIV, 27  &ndash; ‘εμφοβοι’  &ndash; ‘emphoboi’  &ndash; <q>they
were filled with fear (of God)</q>. There is a good article on fear here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a></p>
<p>Luke XXIV, 38  &ndash; ‘τεταραγμενοι’  &ndash; ‘tetaragmenoi’  &ndash; ‘disturbed,
agitated’. ‘αναβαινοθσιν’  &ndash; ‘anabainousin’  &ndash; ‘ascend upwards’.
Literally, the thoughts of the apostles about the vision of the spirit
<q>went up to their hearts</q>, i.e. <q>went from the bottom up</q>, and the
hearts of the apostles were higher than such doubts.</p>
<p>Luke XXIV, 39  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used only with
emphasis. ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Luke XXIV, 44  &ndash; ‘γεγραμμενα’  &ndash; ‘gegrammena’  &ndash; ‘it is written’. ‘εμου’
- ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Here the description of the Resurrection (the appearance after the
journey with the two disciples to Emmaus) and the Ascension of Jesus
Christ are combined.</p>
<p>It can be assumed (although this is not a common belief among
believers) that on the Day of Resurrection the Lord could also ascend to
the Father, but for a certain time, while on the Day of Ascension He
ascended for a time until His Second Coming.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Lord did not abandon the disciples, and the
Ascension is necessary because it is the way He becomes truly more
glorified, glorifying human nature, which is now in the glory of God,
where the Son of God is always by His Deity. It is also necessary for
them to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
