<p>(John XIII, 31 - XIX, 16, XIX, 25-42; Matthew XXVI, 57 - 75, XXVII,
3-54, 62-66; Mark XV, 16-32, 43-47; Luke XXIII, 32-49 ) The sequence of
the 12 Passion Gospels (here I have connected the consecutive parts that
are read and grouped them by Gospels) that was read last evening. Very
deep texts, I will dwell only on the judgment of Jesus by Pontius
Pilate:

<p>Also, on Friday evening, what was not read in these chapters is
read.</p>
<p>Also, general thoughts about all this can be found at the links:

<p>I will write here only brief comments about the readings of the
Apostle (which are read in the morning at the time when the liturgy is
served on ordinary days). (Galatians VI, 14-18) An introduction to this
reading and preliminary thoughts can be found at the link:

<p>(Romans V, 6-11) Reasoning about death for a good-doer, a righteous
person and a sinner - a good-doer evokes sincere feelings, in particular
gratitude, so you can <q>die with more courage</q> for him or her, a
righteous person cares how to please God, therefore people do not
particularly admire him or her, and sinners - about them among people
just few think with love, let alone suffer for them, and then, when
there were few Christians, almost no one thought except them.</p>
<p>(Hebrews II, 11-18) See the link at the end of the post:
<br><a class="link2" href="07042023.html">07042023.html</a><br></p>
<p>(Hebrews X, 19-31) It speaks of the importance and significance of
the ministry of Jesus, His Sacrifice, and also of the punishment for
trampling His Sacrifice under foot (that is, deliberate unrepentant
contempt).</p>
<p>(1 Corinthians I, 18 - II, 2) Very eloquent and expressive words, in
my opinion. In addition, I will say that <q>to boast</q> means to recognize
the dignity, merit, superiority of something or someone, as well as to
advise others as good. That is, the words that the faithful mean about
the cross of Jesus Christ do not mean that they are proud of it,
consider themselves better than others, but that they see in it a great
meaning, value, a source of strength and wisdom, a manifestation of
great love, an instrument of victory over sins and death, the banner of
victory, and other things that are difficult to understand for those who
do not accept the truth about Jesus.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
