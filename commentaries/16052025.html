Both translations are possible. This refers to Baptism in the name of the Holy Trinity, which is what the Sacrament of Baptism has been from the very beginning, from Pentecost. The first option means to be baptised because they are already Christians, having received the gift of the Holy Spirit and faith in Christ; the second option means that Peter is teaching them to be baptised ‘on behalf of Christ’, as authorised by Christ to speak on His behalf in this (as a representative of Christ).

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Acts X, 45 — ‘οἱ ἐκ περιτομῆς πιστοὶ’ - ‘hoi ek peritomes pistoi’ - ‘those of the circumcised believers’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that these are representatives of those believers in general who shared their common views. 
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 48 — ‘ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ’ - ‘en to onomati Iesou CHristou baptisthenai’ - ‘in the name of Jesus Christ to be baptised; with the name of Jesus Christ to be baptised’. Both translations are possible. This refers to Baptism in the name of the Holy Trinity, which is what the Sacrament of Baptism has been from the very beginning, from Pentecost.

Where to. ‘διεκρίνοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ ἐκ περιτομῆς’ - ‘diekrinonto pros auton hoi ek peritomes’ - ‘those of the circumcised discerned him (he was approached to discern)'.

<reading>(John VIII, 21-30) </reading><br>
These verses are missing from some manuscripts of the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 21 — ‘εν τη αμαρτια υμων αποθανεισθε’ - ‘en te hamartia hymon apothaneisthe’ - ‘in your sin you will die’. Here sin is singular, it refers to the sin of disbelief in Christ, rejection of Him and the Father, the Trinity as a whole.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 23 — ‘υμεις εκ των κατω εστε εγω εκ των ανω ειμι υμεις εκ τουτου του κοσμου εστε εγω ουκ ειμι εκ του κοσμου τουτου’ - ‘hymeis ek ton kato este ego ek ton ano eimi hymeis ek toutou tou kosmou este ego ouk eimi ek tou kosmou toutou’ - ‘you are from below, I am from above, you are of this world, I am not of this world’. The preposition ‘ek’ here refers to the origin of the deeds, lifestyles, attitudes, etc., not to the origin of the people and Jesus. See in particular more about this here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01062024.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01062024.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 24 — ‘αποθανεισθε εν ταις αμαρτιαις υμων’ - ‘apothaneisthe en tais hamartiais hymon’ - ‘you will die in your sins’. Here sins are plural. The point is that by rejecting Christ, the Trinity, these people reject the forgiveness of sins and therefore will die, will go to eternity in sins.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 26 — ‘καγω α ηκουσα παρ αυτου ταυτα λαλω εις τον κοσμον’ - ‘kago ha ekousa par autou tauto lalo eis ton kosmon’ - ‘and I, what I have heard from beside Him, am saying to the world (into the world; for the world)’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case. This construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, and also in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more here:<br>

This indicates that the reference is to the human nature of Jesus Christ, filled with the fullness of the Holy Spirit, and also to what Jesus heard from the Father as a human being, perhaps in prayer.
</p>
<p>
John VIII, 28 — ‘απ εμαυτου ποιω ουδεν’ - ‘ap emautou poio ouden’ - ‘I do nothing out of Myself’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that it is something that can be seen to some extent ‘apart from Christ Himself’, i.e. His action in relation to creation. See the following links for a good and detailed explanation:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30042025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30042025.html</a><br>

</p>
<p>
John VIII, 30 — ‘πολλοι επιστευσαν εις αυτον’ - ‘polloi episteusan eis auton’ - ‘many believed in Him’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here that true faith leads to Christ, He is the goal and the destination of such faith.
