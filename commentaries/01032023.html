<p>(Isaiah II, 3-11) Verse 4 became winged and is a prophecy about the
Kingdom of God. It is in it that people will not have weapons, will not
fight.</p>
<p>In general, the reading explains why God’s <q>intervention</q> is
needed.</p>
<p>(Genesis I, 24 - II, 3) Today’s reading is devoted to the 6th and 7th
day of creation. Again, a very deep text, which also applies to what is
written on the links:
<br><a class="link2" href="27022023.html">27022023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="28022023.html">28022023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Books are interesting materials on the subject
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.myrtlefieldhouse.com/book-store">https://www.myrtlefieldhouse.com/book-store</a><br></p>
<p>I note that animals, like plants, are created <q>according to their
kind</q>, and human - <q>in the image of God</q>. No matter what specific
meaning you put into these words (for example, under <q>image of God</q> you
can understand the immortal soul, you can understand that every person
is a personality, you can have freedom and reason, you can have
something similar), but this emphasizes the difference in the origin of
human and animals with plants.</p>
<p><q>Ours</q> - emphasizes that God is the Holy Trinity - the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit. By the way, the word <q>God</q> in the Old Testament
is very often in the plural - <q>Elohim</q>, where <q>im</q> indicates the plural,
and the verbs relating to God are singular, which emphasizes the unity
of the Holy Trinity (like <q>Gods created</q>).</p>
<p>The 1st chapter of the book of Genesis <q>fits</q> human into the general
context of the creation of the whole world, while the 2nd chapter is
addressed to human himself / herself as a unique being. If in the 1st
chapter human appears as a special part of nature, creation in general,
then in the 2nd we see his / her relationship with God and more
specifics. In the 1st chapter, the participation of the Trinity,
dialogue and the appeal of God to human are outlined, then in the 2nd we
see a picture of relationships. This may be due to the simple logic of
the narrative, where depth increases as the sequel progresses, first
introduction, then story and relationships. But it can also be an
important indication and shed light on who a person is. This can mean
that a person <q>reveals</q> himself / herself fully in his / her
relationship with God and in his / her personal actions and
communication. This can help to understand, in fact, the entire history
of the creation of the world.</p>
<p><q>Male and female created He them</q> - the equality in nature of men and
women, boys and girls, their only and common nature - human is
emphasized.</p>
<p>There are many questions that need to be answered, and therefore
search and interest exist. For example, <q>God did not create death</q>, but
even in Paradise, before the fall of people, the food for people and
animals was herbs and fruits, and this consumption was not called
<q>death</q>, but was an organic component of life.</p>
<p>Another interesting question: is the order of dominion over the
animals in God’s blessing important or not? Does it mean that we need to
start paying more attention to marine animals (fish), then birds, then
land animals, then those that live in land (soil) and in mixed
conditions? Is this order simply the reverse of the order of their
creation by the Word of God - and it only means that God brought all
animals to humans in LIFO / FILO order - the last to be created, because
they were closer to humans (perhaps they did not have time to go far),
were brought first, and the first were already further - and therefore
the last? In general, should it be understood as a scientific material
or as a semantic description (for example, Reverend Maksym the
Confessor, the father of the Church, understood that the first thing
that is said here is not about the creation itself, but more about God’s
designs (seed logos, ideas) regarding it and how these designs then
interacted with matter)? Is this the <q>organic unity</q> of various layers
of understanding described in the first link above?</p>
<p>For example, in relation to the seventh day of creation, the <q>organic
integral unity</q> of meanings is provided by the text. According to the
understanding of the fathers, the seventh day of creation continues
until now and will continue until the Second Coming, when the eighth and
eternal day of creation will come, while God (in particular, the Father)
continues to provide and act in creation. At the same time, this very
structure of creation caused the appearance of the 4th commandment
regarding the Sabbath - the seventh day of rest.</p>
<p>(Proverbs II, 1-22) There is a good essay about the fear of God at
the link:

<p>Wisdom is depicted as a gift from God (one of the gifts of the Holy
Spirit), as something that makes life better, that makes the complicated
simpler.</p>
<p>Next comes a warning against sin. And the prophecy about the Kingdom
of God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
