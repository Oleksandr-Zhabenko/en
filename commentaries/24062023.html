<p><reading>(Romans III, 28  &ndash; IV, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>Here Paul speaks of the salvation of
different people through faith. <q>‘By faith’ means that people have had
experience of living with God, already had some faith, and now it has
been fulfilled, they have waited for the Promised Messiah, Jesus Christ.
Instead,</q>through faith” means that people did not have faith in God
before Jesus Christ came, but through Jesus Christ they came to faith
and cognition of God.</p>
<p>In this sense, faith is central.</p>
<p>Abraham, who believed God, is set as an example for all.</p>
<p><q>Has praise</q>  &ndash; in its proper sense  &ndash; <q>a reason to boast</q> (<q>an object
of praise, something to boast about</q>), but it can also mean the action
of <q>boasting</q>. It was faith that made Abraham righteous, for works can
have other explanations and reasons than God’s will. For example,
Abraham’s hospitality (an active expression of love for different
people, even strangers) was praised by people, but his faith was praised
only by God (a simplistic statement, but faith is more than works in
this sense). Because hospitality had visible benefits that people
understood, whereas the belief that Abraham would have a son in his old
age, that he would become the ancestor of many numerous nations, that
his descendants would inherit the land in which he lived with a few
people as a stranger and a foreigner, that Isaac would live even if he
was sacrificed, and so on  &ndash; this has no other basis than faith, than a
relationship with God, and therefore faith has an advantage over works.
Yes, many people praise Abraham now because his faith was fulfilled, at
least partially and in many significant ways, but at that time almost no
one (except Melchizedek, perhaps Sarah, Lot) praised Abraham’s faith,
but God <q>counted such faith as righteousness</q>.</p>

<p>The building on the rock and sand in the
Sermon on the Mount, its completion and the deeply astonished crowd, and
the healing of the leper.</p>

<p>The basis of life in Christ is the fulfilment of His will and
commandments. Hearing is necessary for knowledge and faith, but the
manifestation of God’s whole design for people in their lives is done
through doing God’s will.</p>
<p>As for the comparison, the scribes and Pharisees taught as experts
(to a certain extent confidently where there was no doubt or dispute),
but Christ taught with authority, that is, as the Lawgiver.</p>
<p>Regarding the healing of the leper, he correctly says that if Christ
wants to, He will heal, so the leper shows the necessary faith, and
Christ immediately heals, showing His mercy and compassion for humanity.
And as the fulfiller of the Law, He tells us what to do next.</p>
<p>To the Holy Apostles Bartholomew and Barnabas: (Acts XI, 19-26,
29-30; Luke X, 16-21) About the successful ministry of the Apostle
Barnabas together with Saul (the Apostle Paul).</p>
<p>Luke X, 16  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘Me’. ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Luke X, 21  &ndash; ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before, in front of the
face’.</p>
<p>Similar to Matthew’s passage on joy in the Holy Spirit (Matthew XI,
25). See also the explanation of John’s Gospel here:
