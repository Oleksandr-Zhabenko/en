it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Philippians I, 27-II, 4) </reading><br>
Philippians I, 27 — &#39;ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι&#39; - &#39;en heni pneumati&#39; - <q>in one Spirit</q>. Indicates the Holy Spirit, Who both unites and gives strength.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 28 — &#39;ἐν μηδενὶ&#39; - &#39;en medeni&#39; - <q>in nothing</q>. &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν ἀντικειμένων&#39; - &#39;hypo ton antikeimenon&#39; - <q>by those who oppose; through those who oppose</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; with genitive case emphasises that possible fear could be caused not by Paul, but by those who oppose, but Paul is not afraid of them, which indicates freedom in Christ. &#39;ενδειξις απωλειας&#39; - &#39;endeiksis apoleias&#39; - <q>proof of decline, destruction, loss</q>. That is, Paul means that those who oppose the Gospel, they move towards decline, destruction, and this will become clear to all, obvious, will become a testimony for all. And those who defend the faith of the Gospel — this defence serves unto salvation. &#39;ἀπὸ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;apo theou&#39; - <q>from God</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here has two different meanings regarding the faithful and unfaithful, that for those who fall away, this is proof of their departure from God, and for the faithful — salvation is God&#39;s gift.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 29 — &#39;εἰς αὐτὸν πιστεύειν&#39; - &#39;eis auton pisteuein&#39; - <q>to believe into Him</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; emphasises that faith is movement towards Christ, that He is the Goal and Final Point of faith&#39;s movement. Touches on the deep theme of sufferings for Christ&#39;s sake. I wrote briefly earlier, here I give the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 30 — &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - &#39;en emoi&#39; - <q>in me</q>. That is, it is spoken of meanings, feelings, values and the like, which the faithful find in Paul&#39;s life and in him himself.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 1 — &#39;παρακλησις&#39; - &#39;paraklesis&#39; - <q>comfort, consolation</q>. &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. In Whom. &#39;παραμυθιον&#39; - &#39;paramythion&#39; - <q>comfort, solace, consolation</q>. &#39;κοινωνια&#39; - &#39;koinonia&#39; - <q>fellowship, communion, participation, partnership</q>. &#39;σπλαγχνα και οικτιρμοι&#39; - &#39;splankhna kai oiktirmoi&#39; - <q>compassion, sympathy and pity, empathy</q>. The apostle enumerates deeply personal feelings, which show that in Christ people have become close to God, significantly closer than they could think.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 2 — &#39;τὸ αὐτὸ φρονῆτε τὴν αὐτὴν ἀγάπην ἔχοντες σύνψυχοι τὸ ἓν φρονοῦντες&#39; - &#39;to auto phronete ten auten agapen ekhontes sympsykhoi to hen phronountes&#39; - <q>think the same, having the same love, being of one soul and one mind</q>.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 3 — &#39;ἐριθείαν&#39; - &#39;eritheian&#39; - <q>rivalry, ambitions</q>.
</p>
<p>
A very rich and dense description of Christian life and way of thinking, worldview, behaviour, one of the most vivid in all Scripture. I will not focus in detail on each verse, since each is worthy of great attention particularly, and all together also. I will add that the continuation of this reading is that which is often read in honour of the Mother of God, Who is a wonderful example of virtues, particularly also all enumerated here.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke VI, 17-23) </reading><br>
Luke VI, 17 — &#39;ἀπὸ πάσης&#39; - &#39;apo pases&#39; - <q>from all</q>. &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν νόσων&#39; - &#39;apo ton noson&#39; - <q>from diseases</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that people left completely the regions, also completely got rid of their diseases, complete total healing. The very word <q>healing</q> has a root from the word <q>whole</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 18 — &#39;ἀπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων&#39; - &#39;apo pneumaton akatharton&#39; - <q>from unclean spirits</q>. See just above.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 19 — &#39;παρ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;par autou&#39; - <q>from beside Him</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; is here with genitive case. Such a construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father in the Godhead. I already wrote earlier that this parallel is essential and mysterious — here it emphasises the fullness of the Holy Spirit in Christ according to His human nature — through His human nature people received God&#39;s gifts and healing. He truly is the promised Anointed One, Messiah, Christ. See also at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 20 — &#39;εἰς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis tous mathetas autou&#39; - <q>into His disciples; onto His disciples</q>. Here it is not entirely clear how exactly Christ looked at the disciples, somehow specially, perhaps not at all, perhaps as if inside as the Heart-knower and Lord.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 23 — &#39;ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ&#39; - &#39;en ekeine te hemera&#39; - <q>in that day; on that day</q>. Common expression. &#39;ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ&#39; - &#39;en to ourano&#39; - <q>in the heaven</q>. Where.
