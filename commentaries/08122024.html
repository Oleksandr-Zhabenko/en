it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Ephesians II, 14-22) </reading><br>
Ephesians II, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ’ - ‘en te sarki’ - ‘in the flesh; with the flesh’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating the weaknesses of human nature as something that participates in the salvation of people, and the second indicating that the weaknesses themselves were healed by being accepted by the Son of God. ‘ἐν δόγμασιν’ - ‘en dogmasin’ - ‘in decrees’. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ εἰς ἕνα καινὸν ἄνθρωπον’ - ‘en auto eis ena kainon anthropon’ - ‘in Himself into one new human being; by Himself into one new human being’. Both translations are possible, and both emphasise that the Son of God creates a renewed human being in salvation - His human nature - and through it renews other people.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι’ - ‘en eni somati’ - ‘in one body’. This refers to the Church as the Body of Christ. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘with it; in it’. Both translations are possible, and both emphasise the significance of the cross of the Lord as an instrument of salvation.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι’ - ‘en eni pneumati’ - ‘in One Spirit; by One Spirit’. Both translations are possible, the first referring to the Holy Spirit as the One who accompanies to the Father, and the other - to Him as the One Who leads.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 21, 22 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en o’ - ‘in Whom’. ‘εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον ἐν κυρίῳ’ - ‘eis naon agion en kyrio’ - ‘into the holy temple in the Lord’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates movement and development - where.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 22 &mdash; ‘εἰς κατοικητήριον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν πνεύματι’ - ‘eis katoiketerion tou theou en pneumati’ - ‘into the dwelling place of God in the Spirit (by the Spirit)’.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XVII, 12-19) </reading><br>
Luke XVII, 12 &mdash; ‘εἴς τινα κώμην’ - ‘eis tina komen’ - ‘into a certain village; into some village’. That is, the name of the village is not given here. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ὑπάγειν’ - ‘en to hypagein’ - ‘in walk; during the walk; when walking’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐξ αὐτῶν’ - ‘ex auton’ - ‘of them’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates here a choice from several persons.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 16 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τοὺς πόδας’ - ‘para tous podas’ - ‘to the proximity of the feet’. That is, as close to the feet as possible. The preposition ‘para’ is here with an accusative.
