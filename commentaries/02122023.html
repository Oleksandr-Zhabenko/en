Paul goes on to show that the Law did not contain the fullness of faith, and thus we cannot assume that we should limit ourselves to it, or that there is and will be anything better than the Law. To this end, he compares quotations from various passages of the Old Testament that show in a figurative way that the faith fulfilled in Christ will replace the ceremonialism of the Law, being superior and being the fulfilment of what was promised through and before the Law.

Another important image is the expectation and readiness for the Coming of Christ. When someone is waiting for someone to come, this state is known to almost everyone. It is with this state that Christ compares how we should treat the expectation of His Coming.
