            Christ Was Baptized!<br>

        <p>There were two readings today, one of which is dedicated to St. Nina (although it is advisable to postpone her service to another day).</p>
        <p>The parable of the 10 virgins was read to Saint Nina (Matthew XXV, 1-13), because Nina assimilated her life and faith to the wise virgins and wisely spent the time. From the Apostle, it was read about apostolic work for the guidance of all of us.</p>
        <p>
            <reading>(Mark XII, 1-13) </reading>
        </p>
        <p>The parable of the criminal winemakers, which we recently analyzed, was read from the regular Gospel. Parallel with the <q>cornerstone</q> in the reading of the Apostle.</p>
        <p>
            <reading>(1 Peter I, 1-2, 10-12; II, 6-10) </reading>
        </p>
        <p>1 epistle of the Apostle Peter was read as the regular Apostle. Peter speaks about the fulfillment of prophecies in Christ, about the salvation of the faithful people from all over the world.</p>
        <p>Verses 1 Peter II, 9-10 are a testimony of the general calling of all the faithful (not only priests) to sanctification, dominion (victory) over sin, implementation of God's will (and one's own in agreement with God's) with the aim of spreading salvation to all, making it manifested, glorified, to unite people into the great family of Christ.</p>
        <p><q>they were appointed to which</q>  &ndash; it looks like the Lord <q>appointed</q> them, i.e. made them unbelievers, but in fact they set themselves up for unbelief. The Lord permitted them their unbelief, knowing that they would not believe, but He did everything so that, if they might believe, they would be saved from all the evil. Christ became a <q>temptation</q> for them because of their disobedience to God, </p>
        <p>â€” being the <q>rock of salvation</q>, but they made Him a <q>rock of temptation</q> for themselves â€” where faith and trust should have been shown, they showed doubt and rejection.</p>
        <p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
