it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
The early one:<br>
<reading>(Matthew XXVIII, 16-20) </reading><br>
For more information about the Gospel reading, please refer to the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19042025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts V, 12-20) </reading><br>
Acts V, 12 — ‘σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πολλὰ ἐν τῷ λαῷ’ - ‘semeia kai terata polla en to lao’ - ‘many signs and wonders in the people; frequent signs and wonders in the people’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating quantity, the second frequency, permanence. 'ἐν τῇ στοᾷ Σολομῶντος' - ‘en te stoa Solomontos’ - ‘in Solomon's porch; in Solomon's portico (a place in the courtyard of the temple where there were colonnade and a roof)’. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 15 — <q>ὥστε καὶ εἰς τὰς πλατείας ἐκφέρειν τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς</q> - <q>hoste kai eis tas plateias ekpherein tous astheneis</q> - <q>so that to carry the sick into (the) streets</q>. The infinitive is somewhat unusual here, most likely the author did not want to use the past tense to avoid the impression that this was only in the past, but wanted to draw attention to faith and the corresponding ongoing practice. The preposition indicates where the infirm were carried to.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 16 — <q>ἀσθενεῖς καὶ ὀχλουμένους ὑπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων</q> - <q>astheneis kai okhloumenous hypo pneumaton akatharton</q> - 'the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits; the sick and those who have been tormented by unclean spirits; the sick and those who have suffered from unclean spirits'. Suffering from unclean spirits is here listed alongside sickness and infirmity. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case and indicates that it is the passive voice of the participle ‘tormented’.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 18 — <q>ἔθεντο αὐτοὺς ἐν τηρήσει δημοσίᾳ</q> - <q>ethento autous en teresei demosia</q> - <q>they put them in the public prison</q>. Where, not where to. This may indicate that the faithful did not visibly resist this, but rather that they <q>were okay with it</q>. This detail further emphasises the faith and miracle of God's deliverance through the angel.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 20 — <q>ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τῷ λαῷ</q> - <q>en to hiero to lao</q> - <q>in the temple to the people</q>. Where and to whom.

<p>
<reading>(John XX, 19-31) </reading><br>
On verses John XX, 19-25, see here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XX, 26 — 'εἰς τὸ μέσον' - 'eis to meson' - 'into the midst'. Where to. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
John XX, 27 — <q>βάλε εἰς τὴν πλευράν μου</q> - <q>bale eis ten pleuran mou</q> - <q>put in My side</q>. The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates to where Thomas should put his hand.
</p>
<p>
John XX, 30 — <q>ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ</q> - <q>en to biblio touto</q> - <q>in this book</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
John XX, 31 — ‘ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ’ - ‘en to onomati autou’ - ‘in His name; with His name’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that life according to Christ as God, Lord and Saviour is true and will last forever, and the second - that everything Jesus did is for our true life.
