<p><reading>(Galatians IV, 28  &ndash; V, 10) </reading>
</p>
<p>Galatians IV, 30, 31  &ndash; ‘ελευθερας’ -
‘eleutheras’  &ndash; ‘free’.</p>
<p>Galatians V, 1  &ndash; ‘ελευθερια’  &ndash; ‘eleutheria’  &ndash; ‘freedom, liberty’.
‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’. ‘ηλευθερωσεν’  &ndash; ‘eleutherosen’  &ndash; ‘liberated,
freed’.</p>
<p>There is a good multi-part essay on freedom here:

<p>Galatians V, 5  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>Paul uses the example of Sarah and Hagar and their children to show
the power of God’s promise and the value of freedom and liberation.</p>
<p>The conclusion of chapter IV is logically a continuation of what is
also written at the following link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="13092023.html">13092023.html</a></p>
<p>In Christ we have access to all of God’s promises. Therefore, the
event with Isaac and Ishmael has a figurative meaning  &ndash; the Lord
encouraged Abraham to leave Isaac, the son of promise, as his heir, not
because it was necessary at that time, but mainly because it was to be a
prototype in Christ for the believers in the New Testament, who were to
be <q>sons of the free</q> and not <q>of the slave</q>. This is the way to
understand why the Lord spoke those words. The conflict between the
children of Abraham could have been settled differently, but for the
sake of the prototype and all the believers in the New Testament, the
Lord said to do it this way. It should be noted that He continued to
care for Hagar and Ishmael, and the latter became the ancestor of the
Arabs.</p>
<p>See also more about Hagar and Ishmael in the readings for Lent
referred to here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="29032023.html">29032023.html</a></p>
<p>In chapter V, Paul expands on this idea and also shows that there is
no good in going back to the Old Testament when you should be going to
the New. There is no point in becoming Jews when you need to become
Christians. The Galatians were faced with just such a temptation.</p>
<p>If someone forced Christians to be circumcised and to fulfil the
entire ceremonial law of Moses, then instead of Christ, instead of
grace, they were <q>returning to the Old Covenant</q>, when there was no
redemption, no liberation in Christ from the slavery of sin, but
preparation and expectation for Him, for the Messiah-Christ. And if
anyone, knowing this, realising this, continues to force the fulfilment
of the entire ceremonial Mosaic Law, including circumcision, then such a
person neglects the grace in Christ, as Paul writes.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark VI, 54  &ndash; VII, 8) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark VI, 55  &ndash; ‘κακως εχοντας’  &ndash; ‘kakos
ekhontas’  &ndash; literally <q>(something) very bad, evil to the having (those
who have)</q>. As I wrote earlier, this is how Mark refers to complex and
serious illnesses. See more here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="24082023.html">24082023.html</a></p>
<p>Mark VII, 6  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (from) ‘Me’. The quote is from Isaiah
XXIX, 13, see also here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="24032023.html">24032023.html</a></p>
<p>For a parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XIV, 35  &ndash; XV, 11), read
here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="19072023.html">19072023.html</a></p>
<p>Mark adds an explanation of the traditions of the Jews for the Romans
because he was writing to Christians in Rome who might not know the
details of Jewish life.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Christ is not opposed to hygiene or washing
dishes (some of these rules are in the Law, which the Lord kept, and He
did not deny greetings and foot washing as such, for He Himself
participated in them and even set an example by washing the disciples’
feet at the Last Supper). But He opposes ascribing to hygiene rules and
human conventions the weight of God’s ordinances and commandments,
<q>levelling them in weight and significance</q>, as the Pharisees did.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
