<meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul gives thanks to God for the Ephesians and solemnly glorifies and confesses his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father, in the glorification of the Son of God in human nature, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Head of the Church and the Church is His mystical Body, here called the 'fullness of Him Who fills everything within'. God reveals in the faithful the riches of His generosity, which He shows to all creation, but most of all and supremely to the Church. Every action of God in the world and towards the world is somehow connected with the Church - at least as a means of implementation - so that the Church may unite and grow in God, in His knowledge, glory, holiness, etc., in general, in the deification of creation, and all creation that is not the Church may be drawn closer to God through it, sanctified.  The Lord Jesus expands on the Old Testament idea that one should be modest not only in the presence of a king, but in general. The general idea is that believers should not seek for honour, but at the same time should not be ashamed or refuse true honour. Links to other commentaries.">

<reading>(Ephesians I, 16-23) </reading><br>
Continuation and partly has two verses in common with the reading I wrote about here:<br>

A continuation of this reading (and also has 2 verses in common with it) is the one I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25092023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25092023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians I, 16 &mdash; 'προσευχων' - 'proseuchon' - 'prayers' (the word means uplifting, high prayers).
</p>
<p>
Ephesians I, 17 &mdash; 'ημων' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).
</p>
<p>
Ephesians I, 19 &mdash; 'ἡμᾶς' - 'emas' - 'us'.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul thanks God for the Ephesians and solemnly glorifies and confesses faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father, in the glorification of the Son of God in the human nature, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Head of the Church, and the Church is His mystical Body, here called <q>fulness of Him Who fills everything with all.</q>
</p>
<p>
The beginning is generalised in the conclusion of the reading &mdash; God reveals in the faithful the riches of His generosity, which He shows to all creation, but most of all and above all to the Church.
</p>
<p>
The Church is called <q>fullness</q> not because it <q>completes</q> the Son of God or His glory, but because it contains the ultimate goal of all creation &mdash; that the Church unite with God and that all creation be sanctified through it. And so, every action of God in the world and towards the world is somehow related to the Church - at least as a purpose of accomplishment - so that the Church unites and grows in God, in His cognition, glorification, holiness, etc., in general, in the deification of creation, and all creation that is not the Church is drawn closer to God through it, sanctified.

<reading>(Luke XIV, 1-11) </reading><br>
The continuation of this reading is the one I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13112023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13112023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Luke XIV, 2 &mdash; 'ἔμπροσθεν' - 'emprosthen' - 'before the face; before'.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIV, 5 &mdash; 'ἡμέρᾳ' - 'emera' - (of) 'day'.
</p>
<p>
As for the beginning of the reading, there is a similar passage in Matthew (Matthew XII, 1-8 ), which I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30062023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30062023.html</a>

</p>
<p>
Regarding the second part and the parable, the parallel with Proverbs XXV, 6 is noted. It speaks of not being exalted in the presence of a king.
</p>
<p>
The Lord Jesus expands on this idea by saying that it is not only in the presence of a king that one should be humble, but also in general.
</p>
<p>
The general idea here is that believers should not be seeking and loving honour, but at the same time should not be ashamed of or refuse true honour.

In this sense, this reading is a direct continuation of yesterday's.
