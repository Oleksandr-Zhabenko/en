it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent started, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by considering the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint. 
</p>
<p>
At the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah I, 19-II, 3) </reading><br>
Isaiah I, 21 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾗ’ - ‘en he’ - ‘in it’. ‘ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘en aute’ - ‘in it’.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah I, 24 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις’ - ‘en tois hypenantiois’ - ‘in the enemies’. In other words, the Lord will be honoured with regard to his enemies and will be glorified by his victory over them. ‘κρίσιν ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν’ - ‘krisin ek ton ekhthron’ - ‘judgement upon the adversaries’. That is, the Lord will judge those who adversely oppose Him, for example, the devil.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah I, 25 &mdash; ‘πυρώσω σε εἰς καθαρόν’ - ‘pyroso se eis katharon’ - ‘I will purify you by fire for purity (into purity)’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the state to which the Lord will bring Zion. ‘ἀπὸ σοῦ’ - ‘apo sou’ - ‘from you’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the Lord will completely cleanse Zion of the lawlessness.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah I, 26 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς - ‘ap arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the point from which the countdown is made here. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah II, 1 &mdash; ‘παρὰ κυρίου’ - ‘para kyriou’ - ‘from beside the Lord’. The preposition ‘para’ is with the genitive case here and indicates that the word was from the Holy Spirit for Christ's sake. A similar construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father and to the human nature of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah II, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις’ - ‘en tais eskhatais hemerais’ - ‘in the last days’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah II, 3 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ ὄρος κυρίου καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ Ιακωβ’ - ‘eis to oros kyriou kai eis ton oikon tou theou Iakob’ - ‘to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob’. That is, ‘where to’. ‘ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘en aute’ - ‘in it; on it (the road)’. ‘ἐκ γὰρ Σιων’ - ‘ek gar Sion’ - ‘because from Sion; because out of Sion’. ‘ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘ex Ierousalem’ - ‘from Jerusalem’. In both cases, the preposition ‘ek’ indicates where the Law and the Word of the Lord will come from.

</p>
<p>
At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis I, 14-23) </reading><br>
Genesis I, 14, 15, 17 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ’ - ‘en to stereomati tou ouranou’ - ‘in the firmament of the heaven; in the firmness of the heaven’. ‘εἰς φαῦσιν’ - ‘eis phausin’ - ‘to emit light; to illuminate’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. ‘εἰς σημεῖα καὶ εἰς καιροὺς καὶ εἰς ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς ἐνιαυτοὺς’ - ‘eis semeia kai eis kairous kai eis hemeras kai eis eniautous’ - ‘for signs, and for times (seasons, epochs, ordered time intervals, periods), and for days, and for years’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates purpose.  
</p>
<p>
Genesis I, 16 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἀρχὰς τῆς ἡμέρας’ - ‘eis arkhas tes hemeras’ - ‘to rule (’have precedence over‘) the day’. ‘εἰς ἀρχὰς τῆς νυκτός’ - ‘eis arkhas tes nyktos’ - ‘to rule (over) the night’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose. What is important is that what makes sense, organises, orders, is what becomes ruling.
</p>
<p>
Genesis I, 22 &mdash; ‘τὰ ὕδατα ἐν ταῖς θαλάσσαις’ - ‘ta hydata en tais thalassais’ - ‘the waters in the seas’. Plural.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs I, 20-33) </reading><br>
Proverbs I, 20 &mdash; ‘σοφία ἐν ἐξόδοις ὑμνεῖται ἐν δὲ πλατείαις παρρησίαν ἄγει’ - ‘sophia en exodois hymneitai en de pleteiais parresian agei’ - ‘Wisdom in exodus sings spiritual hymns and in open squares and streets (places) boldly, openly, confidently, freely leads’. In other words, wisdom allows you to sing praises to God and give thanks in elevation and joy at the end of the case, and also allows you to feel confident in public, including being a leader, speaking, and leading others. By the way, a direct call to an open, free society in wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs I, 33 &mdash; ‘ἡσυχάσει ἀφόβως ἀπὸ παντὸς κακοῦ’ - ‘hesykhasei aphobos apo pantos kakou’ - ‘will be calm and fearless of all evil’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that such a person will be completely free from anxiety and fear of evil, completely safe.
