it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Thessalonians II, 1-12) </reading><br>
2 Thessalonians II, 2 — &#39;εἰς τὸ μὴ ταχέως σαλευθῆναι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ νοὸς&#39; — &#39;eis to me takheos saleuthenai hymas apo tou noos&#39; - <q>so that you not quickly be shaken from the mind (manner of thinking; worldview)</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the purpose of the action, and the preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates the false cause: the apostle means that although someone thinks it reasonable to consider that the Kingdom of God has already come (considers this the <q>mind</q>), but in reality — no, because it has not yet come until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 4 — &#39;εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;eis ton naon tou theou&#39; - <q>into the temple of God; into the sanctuary of God</q>. That is <q>where to?</q>, not <q>where?</q> he will sit. Regarding the Jerusalem temple in the Gospels almost always another word is used. It can also mean figurative <q>sitting</q>, that is, the spread of worldview, information, preaching, rumours and so on in the temple, which will welcome the antichrist.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 6 — &#39;εἰς τὸ ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ καιρῷ&#39; — &#39;eis to apokalyphthenai auton en to autou kairo&#39; - <q>so that to be manifested (revealed; a word with the same root as </q>revelation<q>) in his own time</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose of the action. It is worth adding that restraint may be connected with time — that is <q>restrains so that he be manifested [not before] his time</q>. Restraint is also rather directed towards circumstances (which prevent his appearance), rather than the person of the antichrist himself (who will appear only at the end of the world). Otherwise it would be necessary to think that the antichrist already exists, but awaits <q>manifestation</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 7 — &#39;ἐκ μέσου&#39; — &#39;ek mesou&#39; - <q>out of the midst; from within</q>. Common expression. With regard to what is written at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/18072025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/18072025.html</a><br>

these can be polysemous words.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 9 — &#39;ἐν πάσῃ δυνάμει καὶ σημείοις καὶ τέρασιν ψεύδους&#39; — &#39;en pase dynamei kai semeiois kai terasin pseudous&#39; - <q>in all power, and signs, and false wonders; with all power, and signs, and false wonders</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, which complement one another.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 10 — &#39;ἐν πάσῃ ἀπάτῃ ἀδικίας&#39; — &#39;en pase apate adikias&#39; - <q>in all deception of unrighteousness; with all deception of unrighteousness</q>. Both variants of translation are possible. &#39;εἰς τὸ σωθῆναι&#39; - &#39;eis to sothenai&#39; - <q>to be saved</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 11 — &#39;εἰς τὸ πιστεῦσαι αὐτοὺς τῷ ψεύδει&#39; - &#39;eis to pisteusai autous to pseudei&#39; - <q>for them to believe the lie</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose of the action. As I wrote earlier, the Apostle Paul sometimes following Old Testament people does not distinguish between God&#39;s permission (that which God does not want, but permits) and God&#39;s will (that which God wants). This is an example of precisely such non-distinction: where it is meant <q>God will permit</q> people the antichrist (God does not want him to become such, but will permit it), Paul writes <q>God will send</q> the antichrist to people.
</p>
<p>

<p>
In general a mysterious place, which is often understood differently. Most believe that the antichrist here is a completely real person who will appear before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Moreover, this place is one of the most obvious indications of the reality (and not symbolism or allegory) of the antichrist.
</p>
<p>
At the same time in the Gospels the topic of his appearance is not given significant attention, there are only indirect mentions and references to the prophecies of the Old Testament, which complicates understanding. It can be thought that this is because speculation on the topic of the antichrist is often unfounded and ultimately strengthens in many people despair.
</p>
<p>
Also there are different opinions about what is meant regarding who or what restrains the appearance of the antichrist. For example, there is an opinion that it is the Holy Spirit, or another — that it is the former Roman (legal) state (it could now be said — strong international law and state authorities), there are also other opinions.
</p>
<p>
The entire logic of the construction and actions of the antichrist comes from the fact that the devil would like his coming as quickly as possible, and something from God restrains the fulfilment of this desire.
</p>
<p>
It is also often understood that repentance of people <q>moves away</q> the time of the end of the world, whereas mindlessness of people and unrepented sins bring it nearer. God knows the exact time and all circumstances as All-knowing, but from the point of view of people — events appear precisely so.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is also important that the antichrist should not be the centre of the attention of the faithful, since the faithful belong to God. But it is also wrong to neglect what is known about him, because it has been revealed by God to people.

<reading>(Luke XII, 48-59) </reading><br>
Luke XII, 48 — &#39;παρ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;par autou&#39; — <q>from beside him</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; in its form before the following vowel is here with the genitive case. Such construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf</a><br>
It can be thought that since a person is given God&#39;s gifts through the Son of God and the Holy Spirit, the Lord also expects from those to whom much is given, likeness to Christ, godlikeness and fruits of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 51 — &#39;ἐν τῇ γῇ&#39; — &#39;en te ge&#39; - <q>in the earth</q>. Where? It is spoken about the settled constant peace.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 52 — &#39;ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν&#39; — &#39;apo tou nyn&#39; - <q>from now on</q>. Common expression, the preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates from which moment in time the action takes place. &#39;ἐν ἑνὶ οἴκῳ&#39; - &#39;en heni oiko&#39; - <q>in one house</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 57 — &#39;ἀφ&#39; ἑαυτῶν&#39; — &#39;aph heauton&#39; - <q>from yourselves</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following &#39;he&#39; indicates that the conclusions reached should be more objective. It can also be thought that to think <q>from yourselves</q> means that people will not know exactly the time and circumstances of the end of the world, but will have different opinions on the subject. The Lord encourages thinking, but does not encourage trusting various ideas. <q>Be ready!</q>, but <q>you do not know</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 58 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ&#39; — &#39;en te odo&#39; - <q>on the way</q>. &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from him</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that deliverance from the adversary should be complete, entire. &#39;εἰς φυλακήν&#39; - &#39;eis phylaken&#39; - <q>into prison</q>. Where to. Emphasises that the faithful will not desire this, but can become victims.
</p>
<p>
In general here it is spoken mostly about readiness for God&#39;s judgement, God&#39;s visitations, also about difficulties in relations with people because of faith, when it will be necessary to keep it contrary to the surroundings, even one&#39;s nearest relatives.
</p>
<p>
It is also spoken about discord and disputes, conflicts, about the importance of reconciliation and peace as such.
</p>
<p>
<q>Not peace, but division</q> — means the extraordinary effectiveness of Gospel truths in their acceptance and implementation in life by people — literally they are so <q>active</q> (compare with chemically-active reagents), they have so much energy, action, power, that people, uniting with Christ, cannot help but activate a great many processes — evident and not evident around and even at a distance. Therefore life according to the Gospel — not passive, but active; not quiet, but dynamic and driving; not slow, but saturated and so on. And the best this state can describe the element of fire, hence the comparison.
</p>
<p>
But as in nature various substances are often very tightly bound together, and there may arise in people a need in their separation, transformation and so on, so also regarding the Gospel — its manifestations are very energetic and active, and otherwise it is not possible to save some people.
</p>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ also says that people in general pay little attention to faith, understanding of God&#39;s truths, knowledge of truth, whereas they focus much more on earthly applications of their knowledge. And this is wrong.
</p>
<p>
And also He teaches that reconciliation should be active — we should strive and care for peace, rather than wait for the actions of others.
</p>
