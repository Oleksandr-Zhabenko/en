Remark<br>
I wrote these texts earlier here as a sermon, and in sermons very often direct quotation is avoided, therefore I, writing about the self of a person, did not mention that there are similar reflections in deacon Andrei Kuraev in one of his works. Since I now see that this text has not only the significance of a sermon, I am simply obliged to indicate that there is material which served as the starting point of my independent and original reflections, more simply speaking, to indicate that there is something similar in another well-known author.<br>
Pray for me, a sinner!

Text of the material<br>
Now the first parable: about the Trinity and Christ. Imagine, here is a house, in which three masters of this house dwell. They have a multitude of servants who serve them in this house. These three lords live in complete harmony with one another, they love one another very much, more than the closest and nearest brothers. If one says something, the two others completely agree. If one begins to do something, the two others help him in everything, and everything is common to them, there is no elder and younger among them, but they are equal. Peacefully and well they live always, eternally. Therefore the servants always know that these three are as one lord, since they always act in everything commonly, together, in complete unity. And behold a person, a traveller found themselves far from home. And behold these three lords invited to themselves into the house the traveller-person from a distant land. And that one agreed. He walked with difficulty, although the servants of the lords helped him, and the lords sent him money for the journey and food, and the traveller walked. From afar he sometimes heard stories of the servants about the lords, sometimes the lords also transmitted some words to him. But since these three lords always spoke together, the traveller also could not distinguish them, and did not know how many these lords were. He thought thus: the one who owns all that house and wealth, servants calls me to himself. And (this traveller — the Israelite people in the Old Testament, servants — Angels) behold the traveller reached the house at last, and one lord of the three came out to meet him, and gave his strength and even sacrificed his health defending the traveller from robbers who attacked. After this the Traveller managed to enter the house. And here he saw that in the house are three lords, though earlier he thought that one. Here he learned that the person who sacrificed himself, saved him from robbers — one of the lords, here the traveller became more closely acquainted with the third of the lords, who promised to be with the traveller in the house always. And finally the person loved the first lord also, as also the two others. Earlier he heard the voice of their songs, when he walked to the house, but at a distance could not distinguish three voices, but always heard one singing. Earlier he thought about the fact that one sent servants for him, but now in the house he saw three. He understood that those three called him, so that the traveller would share with them their wealth. Yes, they will own the wealth always, but the traveller will also dispose of it with their knowledge and consent. And the traveller loved them, and remained with them forever, for ever. Thus it happened with the Israelite people and all mankind, as with this traveller. At a distance he saw the unity of the three, but when he entered the house, he recognised each of the lords, learned both about their unity and about love. So also the People of God first learned about the One God, about Unity, since it was outside God's house. When the Kingdom of Heaven drew near, when the people entered God's house, they saw that Three are in Him, but they — are One, they — are the Lord of the house, Lord and God.

Now about the distinction of consciousness and Self. A person often acts unconsciously. But if we ask who did this unconscious action, it is obvious that the person must acknowledge: I. Not my consciousness, but I. Now about the fact that Self is not a logical category. I will give several simple examples of the use of the word I by a person (similar reflections on a somewhat different occasion are in the work of deacon Andrei Kuraev, see the mention in the <q>Remark</q> above).<br>
<ul><br>
	<li>A person soiled her clothing. About this she said: I am dirty.</li><br>
	<li>A person feels bodily pain. She says: It hurts me.</li><br>
	<li>A person feels a surge of spiritual joy and strength. She says: I rejoice. And so on.</li><br>
</ul><br>
You see, in the first case the person relates the word I to her clothing which she wears (for her clothing is precisely dirty). In the second: calls I her body (and her hypostasis). In the third calls I her soul also her hypostasis. You see how greatly the meanings of the word I regarding a person can differ, who has only one hypostasis? (end of similarity to Kuraev's work)<br>
Therefore the term (word) Self is not quite a logical category, since it can change its meaning depending on various reasons. Hypostasis — is a logical category.
