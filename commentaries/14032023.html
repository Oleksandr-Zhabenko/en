<p><reading>(Isaiah IX, 9  &ndash; X, 4) </reading>
</p>
<p>Again, the Greek and Hebrew texts differ.</p>
<p>The prophecy of God’s judgment on those who, even during God’s
judgment, continue to increase their pride and arrogance, who are puffed
up with their plans during God’s judgment and do not seek repentance,
conversion, do not seek God. Such a state makes people incorrigible,
rooted in evil, which is why even through judgment and their suffering,
the Lord tries to lead such people to the repentance.</p>
<p>And evil unrepentant people at the time of judgment do not want to
convert to be cleansed, but increase mutual anger, inflame hatred, try
to <q>establish themselves through laws and regulations</q>. This is how they
increase their sins and that is why God’s judgment continues. All this
is about the present age, before the Second Coming.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis VII, 1-5) </reading>
</p>
<p>God’s word to Noah about the preservation of the
animals and his family and Noah’s obedience.</p>
<p>Regarding the flood and the later settlement of the saved, we have
the same questions as regarding the distribution of the first
people.</p>
<p>See more at the links:
<br><a class="link2" href="08032023.html">08032023.html</a><br> and
others these days.</p>
<p>Regarding animals, there is also the question of whether God
protected them from mutations and diseases related to heredity.</p>
<p>Oh, God, grant me to write about these questions later!</p>
<p>In general, there is a mention of Noah in another place of Scripture:
<q>If there are righteous people on earth like Noah, Daniel and Job, then
they will save their souls</q> (a more extensive text of the passage is
Ezekiel XIV, 13-20). The meaning of the passage of the prophet Ezekiel
is that if iniquity and sins become established among people, and only a
small number of faithful to God remains, then those faithful will be
saved from God’s judgment, but sinners who do not want to repent will
not.</p>
<p>But what kind of righteous people are they and why are they so
mentioned by name? Daniel was very wise and faithful to God even in the
palaces of the Babylonian and Persian kings, and among the lions, and
three young boys among the fire. Job is extremely patient and faithful
in suffering. And Noah, among the society of sinners, was righteous
<q>among these people.</q> All three are examples glorified by God in their
time because of their endurance, which is why Jesus Christ mentions
Noah, for example, and the faithful remember about the last times.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs VIII, 32  &ndash; IX, 11) </reading>
</p>
<p>The call of wisdom to become its
accomplices and partakers of it is also a (proto)type of Communion,
since Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Hypostatic Wisdom of the
Father.</p>
<p>Regarding wine, there is a study, <q>wine</q> was called all drinks made
from grapes, in particular juice and wine mixed with water. The last two
are not intoxicating when properly consumed and are preferred drinks in
Israel at that time. At the same time, the consumption of intoxicating
alcoholic wine was judged as leading to sins. Therefore, it is logical
to think that <q>mixed</q> wine is diluted with water, as it happens in the
liturgy according to the Eastern Tradition (Byzantine, I don’t know if
it is the same in the liturgy of the Western Tradition).</p>
<p>In the verses of Proverbs IX, 7-8, it is said that a wise person
listens to the rebukes and advice of the wise, and an evil person who is
unrepentant will begin to dislike those who rebuke him / her and want to
teach him / her good. That is, Solomon does not mean that only the wise
should be taught good, and the wicked not, but he means that an evil and
unrepentant person will not only be ungrateful, but will also begin to
treat those who want him / her to become good. We must be aware of this,
but this cannot be a reason not to try at all to promote the conversion
and correction of evil people, especially among Christians.</p>
<p>There is a good essay about the fear of God at the link:
