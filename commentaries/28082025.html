it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians VII, 1-10) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians VII, 1 — &#39;ἀπὸ παντὸς μολυσμοῦ σαρκὸς καὶ πνεύματος&#39; - &#39;apo pantos molysmou sarkos kai pneumatos&#39; - <q>from all defilement (corruption) of flesh and spirit</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises complete cleansing, total. The pair <q>flesh</q>-<q>spirit</q> are opposite components, that is actually it is spoken of cleansing of all human nature, complete and total. &#39;ἐπιτελοῦντες ἁγιωσύνην ἐν φόβῳ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;epitelountes hagiosynen en phobo theou&#39; - <q>accomplishing (making perfect, completed) holiness in the fear of God</q>. The faithful through God&#39;s mercy, generosity, redemption, salvation and other already have a certain gracious holiness, but their work of cleansing can lead them to perfect holiness, to actual complete sanctity.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 3 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν&#39; - &#39;en tais kardiais hemon&#39; - <q>in our hearts</q>. Where. &#39;εἰς τὸ συναποθανεῖν καὶ συνζῆν&#39; - &#39;eis to synapothanein kai synzen&#39; - <q>into dying together and living together; to die together and live together</q>. The first translation is a calque, and the second by meaning. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose of action. The apostle speaks of decisiveness in unity to share both works, and sufferings, and present life, and death, and eternity in resurrection.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 4 — &#39;παρρησια&#39; - &#39;parresia&#39; - <q>freedom, confidence, openness, boldness</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 5 — &#39;εἰς Μακεδονίαν&#39; - &#39;eis Makedonian&#39; - <q>to Macedonia</q>. Where to. &#39;ἐν παντὶ θλιβόμεν&#39; - &#39;en panti thlibomen&#39; - <q>in all tribulations</q>. That is under all difficult circumstances which happened to the apostle for Christ&#39;s sake through his faith and preaching.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 6, 7 — &#39;ταπεινους&#39; - &#39;tapeinous&#39; - <q>low, lowered, humble</q>. &#39;ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te parousia&#39; - <q>in the presence; in the coming; by presence; by coming</q>. All translation variants are possible, they mutually complement the general picture.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῇ παρακλήσει&#39; - &#39;en te paraklesei&#39; - <q>in the comfort; in the consolation; by the comfort; by the consolation</q>. All translation variants are possible.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 8 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ&#39; - &#39;en te epistole&#39; - <q>in the letter; by the letter</q>. Again both variants are possible.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 9 — &#39;εἰς μετάνοιαν&#39; - &#39;eis metanoian&#39; - <q>into repentance; for repentance; so that you might repent</q>. By meaning the last translation is more precise and more transparent. &#39;ἐν μηδενὶ&#39; - &#39;en medeni&#39; - <q>in nothing</q>. &#39;ἐξ ἡμῶν&#39; - &#39;ex hemon&#39; - <q>from us</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;he&#39; indicates that it is spoken of the true reason — that is so that the apostles would not grieve the faithful. Paul shows love here, for he cares more about the faithful themselves than about desired virtues. Pastorally this is fully justified.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 10 — &#39;εἰς σωτηρίαν&#39; - &#39;eis soterian&#39; - <q>to salvation; for salvation; unto salvation</q>. 
</p>
<p>
In verse 8 Paul mentions an earlier letter to the Corinthians. This might just be 1 Corinthians, for there it is spoken particularly about sins both of one of the Corinthians and of all.
</p>
<p>
Paul often here uses the words &#39;παρακλησις&#39; — &#39;paraklesis&#39; - <q>comfort, consolation</q> and &#39;παρακαλεω&#39; - &#39;parakaleo&#39; - <q>to comfort, console, gladden</q> and derivatives from them. From these same words also the name of the Holy Spirit — Paraclete, Comforter. That is where Paul writes about comfort from God, it is spoken of the action of God&#39;s grace. The event itself — the coming of Titus — can also be called God&#39;s gift, but also here it is meant that God helps Titus to comfort Paul and those who are with him, this is direct action of God&#39;s grace. One can recall the visitation of Elizabeth by the Virgin Mary, about which there is a good work by the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark I, 29-35) </reading><br>
Mark I, 29 — &#39;ἐκ τῆς συναγωγῆς&#39; - &#39;ek tes synagoges&#39; - <q>from the synagogue</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates from where they came out. &#39;εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν Σίμωνος καὶ Ἀνδρέου&#39; - &#39;eis ten oikian Simonos kai Andreou&#39; - <q>into the house of Simon and Andrew; to the house of Simon and Andrew</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates where they came to. Typical combination of prepositions in case of movement.
</p>
<p>
Mark I, 35 — &#39;εἰς ἔρημον τόπον&#39; — &#39;eis eremon topon&#39; - <q>into a desert (solitary; secluded) place</q>. Where to. &#39;προσηύχετο&#39; - &#39;proseukheto&#39; - <q>prayed highly; prayed spiritually</q>.
</p>
<p>
Here, immediately running ahead, I shall say that more obvious is the thought that demons increasingly felt that Jesus — is the Son of God. Still the question remains unclear. Moreover, the word &#39;οτι&#39;, which is used here, can mean both <q>that</q> (they knew Him) and <q>because</q>. That is Jesus could forbid them both that they would reveal, show that they know Him (at least feel, guess), and could forbid because they spoke. One can still say that whether demons said that they know, or <q>did not have time</q>, and the Lord forbade them to do this.
</p>
<p>
The sick are called in Greek &#39;κακως εχοντας&#39; — literally — <q>those who have definite evil; those who have something really bad</q>, that is by this word are called serious illnesses, although in many other places of Scripture the first of these words means something <q>morally evil</q>. Mark here writes very simply.
</p>
<p>
When it is spoken of the causes of illnesses, of their connection with sins, then here it is appropriate to distinguish illness and evil as such (for example, this is very important when we speak about the fact that illness is not sin, and when a person is ill or suffers, this is not their sin, or about the fact that all illnesses are consequence of the fall, but not every illness is consequence of sins of the person himself / herself), but if it is spoken of human perception — then a person truly perceives illness as evil. Mark in this entirely follows human perception.
</p>
<p>
Also here it is spoken of the healing of Peter&#39;s mother-in-law, from which also one can know that Peter was married.
