<p><reading>(1 Corinthians VII, 12-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians VII, 17  &ndash; ‘εμερισεν’ -
‘emerisen’  &ndash; <q>distributed, divided, parted</q>  &ndash; from ‘μεριζω’ -
‘merizo’.</p>
<p>Continuation of yesterday’s reading, which is referred to in the
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="19072023.html">19072023.html</a></p>
<p>It consists of two parts  &ndash; the first speaks of peace in marriage -
through peace and agreement in good and unbelieving people can become
believers, also children can grow up to believe and be good
believers.</p>
<p>The second part concerns the state of man in life with God. These
considerations can be generalized to an almost arbitrary case in the
question of how a person should treat various issues.</p>
<p>It must be said that a literally accurate translation gives
approximately: <q>use more, to a greater extent</q> or another option  &ndash; <q>use
better</q>  &ndash; in both cases the second word is an adverb, i.e. a
characteristic of an action. Therefore, Paul’s opinion is not completely
philologically clear, but from the whole text we can think that he means
<q>use what is better</q> (then it should be not an adverb, but an
adjective).</p>
<p>It can be seen that the view of faith gives a person more inner
freedom and flexibility  &ndash; he or she can see the standards differently.
Flexibility allows you to focus more on your life with God.</p>
<p>Therefore, this part can be generally rephrased as <q>Be flexible where
there is no need to be principled</q>. It is essential to obey God’s
commandments. But if something is not directly related to their
fulfillment or violation, then a person in Christ receives enormous
actual freedom.</p>
<p>Some researchers have already noted that such flexibility (which they
can call in other words) has served the development of modern science
and culture well (in good sense).</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XIV, 35  &ndash; XV, 11) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 8  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (from)
<q>Me</q>.</p>
<p>The question of the Pharisees puts the rule of hygiene on the level
of God’s commandments. I just wrote above that this is fundamentally
wrong and <q>conserves</q> any state in the course of development.</p>
<p>Christ therefore explains their error with an example from another
sphere. He cites an example where cunning manipulation of thoughts
<q>gives permission to a person</q> not to fulfill God’s commandment
(according to the Pharisees, which, of course, does not give such
permission in reality). Researchers note that it is about the fact that
among the Pharisees it was considered the norm that it was enough to
mentally <q>gift something</q> to the temple  &ndash; and these things were already
considered a gift to God. The owners could continue to use them, but
they cannot give them to someone else, because <q>it’s already God’s</q>, not
<q>theirs</q>.</p>
<p>In the Law, this was not even close, so the example shows how it is
possible, putting some less important things and God’s commandments on
the same level, to come to the actual violation of these very
commandments.</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 4 — the translation <q>reviles</q> can be more accurately
translated as <q>angrily insults with words.</q> And the continuation  &ndash; <q>let
he or she end with death.</q> That is, it is not a wish for such a person,
but evidence that he or she is on the path of perishing, the end of
which is death, and which therefore should be guarded against.</p>
<p>Next, Christ explains what defiles a person. Christ means that
<q>impurity, uncleanness</q> is a spiritual concept, not a physical one. It
is not matter itself that defiles a person, but evil thoughts and
sins.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord draws attention to such matters so that people
can live a pure (clean) and godly life.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
