<p>2 Corinthians IX, 8  &ndash; ‘περισσευσαι’  &ndash; ‘periesseusai’  &ndash; ‘to exceed’.
‘αυταρκειαν’  &ndash; ‘autarkeian’  &ndash; ‘self-sufficiency; independence’.
‘περισσευητε’  &ndash; ‘perisseuete’  &ndash; ‘exceed’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians IX, 11  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ ((through) us).
‘απλοτητα’  &ndash; ‘aploteta’  &ndash; ‘simplicity, sincerity, purity’.</p>
<p>Man was created so that he could be gifted with all kinds of grace.

<p>Here Paul writes that people’s generosity in kindness, in good gifts,
in helping leads to the fact that the Lord bestows His mercies and
generosities on them. First of all, this is manifested in graces.</p>
<p>Verse 8, the words from which are mentioned above, says that one
should strive for self-sufficiency, not in isolation, separation
(although this may be necessary and required in the case of bad
influence to eliminate or avoid it), but through mutual cooperation and
help. In this way, a person can become more like God, Who is the One in
the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Verse 11 also emphasises the cleansing effect of generosity and
giving  &ndash; a person who gives generously and willingly learns simplicity
and sincerity, which greatly contributes to and leads to purity of
heart. That is why all these concepts are often mentioned together, and
one often implies the presence of the other(s). A simple and sincere
person often also has greater purity.</p>
<p>The quotations are from various places in the Old Testament,
particularly from the psalms and prophets.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of the spiritual life almost everywhere here, speaking of
<q>you</q> (readers, listeners, addressees). One might think that the Lord
gives spiritual things to people who are truly generous, who give
willingly, from the heart, generously.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VII, 11-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke VII, 13  &ndash; ‘εσπλαγχνισθη’  &ndash; ‘esplankhnisthe’ -
‘had compassion, showed sympathy, pity’.</p>
<p>Luke VII, 16  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; (to) ‘us’ ((in, among) us).</p>
<p>The raising of the son of the widow of Nain is described only in
Luke. Jesus Christ shows mercy and compassion as both God and human. He
raises the son, returns him to his mother, and comforts her and all
those present.</p>
<p>Let me focus on God’s compassion. I have written about it before. See
