<p>To the Mother of God: (Philippians II, 5-11) For this frequent
reading on the feasts in honour of the Mother of God, see the link:

<p>I would add that Paul in verse 5 sets Jesus Christ as an example. He
goes on to speak of the Lordâ€™s humility and His glorification. This
reading also refers to the example of humility and exaltation, the
exaltation of the Mother of God - She was like a maid, but now she is
above all other creatures - above the ranks of angels and the spiritual
heavens.</p>
<p><q>at the name of Jesus</q> - the Greek preposition â€˜ÎµÎ½â€™ - â€˜inâ€™ is used
(as a location, with other possible meanings), so the translation can be
different, for example, <q>in the name of Jesus</q>. This is a reference to
the literal meaning of Jesusâ€™ name - <q>the Lord is the Saviour</q> - that
is, that all creation recognises Jesus not only as Lord, but also as
Saviour. By His self-humbling love, Christ exalted the whole creation,
showing great love for it. <q>â€˜So that every creature may confess,
acknowledge, and therefore experience salvation in the Lord</q>. This does
not mean that all creatures will be saved, but it does mean that the
fruits of Jesusâ€™ saving Sacrifice will be experienced, recognised and
acknowledged by all creatures.</p>
<p>(Luke X, 38-42; XI, 27-28) Luke XI, 27 - â€˜ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î»Î¹Î±â€™ - â€˜koiliaâ€™ - â€˜womb,
belly, inner humanâ€™.</p>
