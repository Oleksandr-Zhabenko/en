it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

the latter — once or twice a month (in Ukrainian), to keep the text version current and up to date.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Peter I, 1-2, 10-12, II, 6-10) </reading><br>
1 Peter I, 2 — &#39;ἐν ἁγιασμῷ πνεύματος&#39; - &#39;en hagiasmo pneumatos&#39; - <q>in sanctification of the Spirit; with sanctification of the Spirit</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that sanctification becomes the mode of existence of the faithful, and the second — that sanctification by the Holy Spirit is important for life. &#39;εἰς ὑπακοὴν καὶ ῥαντισμὸν αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis hypakoen kai rhantismon haimatos Iesou CHristou&#39; - <q>for obedience and sprinkling by the blood of Jesus Christ</q>. Sprinkling here indicates the cleansing of sins, forgiveness, redemption.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter I, 10 — &#39;περὶ τῆς εἰς ὑμᾶς χάριτος&#39; - &#39;peri tes eis hymas charitos&#39; - <q>concerning that which is for you, grace</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose, for whom.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter I, 11 — &#39;εἰς τίνα ἢ ποῖον καιρὸν&#39; - &#39;eis tina e poion kairon&#39; - <q>to what and what kind of time</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the indication to what. &#39;τὸ ἐν αὐτοῖς πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;to en autois pneuma CHristou&#39; - <q>that which is in them, the Spirit of Christ</q>. The Holy Spirit. &#39;τὰ εἰς Χριστὸν παθήματα καὶ τὰς μετὰ ταῦτα δόξας&#39; - &#39;ta eis CHriston pathemata kai tas meta tauta doxas&#39; - <q>those (deeds, events) which are for Christ&#39;s sufferings and those, which are after them, glories</q>. It is spoken about that which will concern Christ, His sufferings and glory. Glories in the plural, for there are many of them, for each action in this entirety is a manifestation of glory.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter I, 12 — &#39;ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ&#39; - &#39;en pneumati hagio&#39; - <q>in the Holy Spirit; with the Holy Spirit</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that the Holy Spirit is needed for the proclamation of the Gospel, and the second — that He is the power of the proclamation of the Gospel. &#39;ἀποσταλέντι ἀπ&#39; οὐρανοῦ&#39; - &#39;apostalenti ap ouranou&#39; - <q>sent from heaven</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that the Holy Spirit is sent as a Gift. &#39;εἰς ἃ&#39; - &#39;eis ha&#39; - <q>into what; upon what</q>. Whither and upon what. The use of the verb <q>strongly desire</q> (<q>lust</q>) indicates that angels also can strongly desire, similarly to people.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter II, 6 — &#39;ἐν γραφῇ&#39; - &#39;en graphe&#39; - <q>in Scripture</q>. Where. &#39;ἐν Σιὼν&#39; - &#39;en Sion&#39; - <q>in Zion; amongst Zion</q>. Where. Indicates that Christ is <q>Zion</q> as the centre of spiritual life and deliverance, that is, He has all the significance which is connected with freedom and affirmation in the good.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter II, 7 — &#39;εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας&#39; - &#39;eis kephalen gonias&#39; - <q>into the head of the corner; into the cornerstone (on which the whole building rests)</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here what significance Christ manifested.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter II, 8 — &#39;εἰς ὃ καὶ ἐτέθησαν&#39; - &#39;eis ho kai etethesan&#39; - <q>into what also they were put; into what they were placed; for what also they were put</q>. Rather the second variant of translation, since disobedience and stumbling are states which the Lord permitted to people who did not believe in Christ. Instead of life in the Holy Spirit, such people live in disobedience and stumblings. Christ became for them <q>a temptation</q> through their disobedience to God, being <q>the rock of salvation</q>, but they made for themselves from Him <q>the rock of temptation</q> — there, where it was necessary to manifest faith and trust, they manifested doubt and rejection.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter II, 9 — &#39;λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν&#39; - &#39;laos eis peripoiesin&#39; - <q>a people into possession; a people into ownership; a people for possession; a people for ownership</q>. All variants of translation are possible, which complement one another. The faithful become God&#39;s possession entirely, devotedly, and allow God to fill their life, will, feelings, mind, powers and so forth. &#39;ὅπως τὰς ἀρετὰς ἐξαγγείλητε τοῦ ἐκ σκότους ὑμᾶς καλέσαντος εἰς τὸ θαυμαστὸν αὐτοῦ φῶς&#39; - &#39;hopos tas aretas exangeilete tou ek skotous hymas kalesantos eis to thaumaston autou phos&#39; - <q>as those who proclaim by the proclamation of the Gospel the virtues of Him Who from darkness called you into His marvellous light</q>. Very eloquent words, which concern both the creation from nothing of people, and their salvation, and divinisation by grace through the gift of being God&#39;s children.

<p>
The ordinary readings on weekdays from the Catholic Epistles of the Apostle Peter begin.
</p>
<p>
Peter speaks about the fulfilment of prophecies in Christ, about the salvation of the faithful from all the world.
</p>
<p>
The verses 1 Peter II, 9-10 — witness of the general calling of all the faithful (not only clergy) to sanctification, dominion (victory) over sin, accomplishment of the will of God (and one&#39;s own in accord with God&#39;s) with the aim to spread salvation to all, to make it manifest, glorified, to unite people in the great family of Christ.
