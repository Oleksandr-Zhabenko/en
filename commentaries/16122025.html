it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

The research material is currently being prepared for publication. I hope, God willing, to present fuller results later after the publication comes out.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy III, 16-IV, 4) </reading><br>
2 Timothy III, 16 — &#39;ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ&#39; — &#39;en dikaiosyne&#39; - <q>in righteousness</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy IV, 2 — &#39;ἐν πάσῃ μακροθυμίᾳ καὶ διδαχῇ&#39; — &#39;en pase makrothymia kai didakhe&#39; - <q>in all longsuffering and teaching; with all longsuffering and teaching</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that longsuffering and teaching (doctrine) are virtues, gifts which are needed in the work of preaching Christ, and the second — that these virtues and gifts themselves are power for preaching.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy IV, 4 — &#39;ἀπὸ μὲν τῆς ἀληθείας&#39; — &#39;apo men tes aletheias&#39; - <q>from the truth</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that the people mentioned here will turn away from the truth, and the emphatic particle indicates contrast — those people contrary to reason and their nature will turn away from truth to myths, fables.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul testifies about the usefulness and value of the Old Testament (it precisely was then called <q>Scripture</q>), and also testifies about difficult times in the future and the need to preach in various circumstances. At the same time Paul emphasises the needed patience. Patience and endurance in (at) that people do not always quickly adopt good teaching and good example. But this still happens, even if not immediately, and not quickly.

that hearts be houses of faithfulness,<br>
and not the dens of robbers.
