<p><reading>(Philippians II, 16-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>Philippians II:16, 22  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’ -
(to) ‘me’. ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; ‘day’.</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterday’s reading, with which verse 16 is
shared, and which is referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="16102023.html">16102023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The apostle Paul testifies to his sacrificial ministry and also
commands us to rejoice with him. See more about this at the link
above.</p>
<p>Paul also writes about his intention to send Timothy (who was also
directly involved in the writing of the letter), who had been a good
co-worker of Paul’s and was even in some ways like a spiritual son of
the apostle of the Gentiles. He describes him as an excellent co-worker.
This characterisation is emphasised by the fact that many people did not
work as hard as Timothy in the field of Christ’s ministry (vv.
20-21).</p>
<p>To <q>seek their own</q> means to look after their own temporal interests
in this life, neglecting to some extent the need to serve God,
Christ.</p>
<p>Paul is waiting for an important question about himself to be
resolved, and then he can send Timothy, whose help was very important to
Paul.</p>
