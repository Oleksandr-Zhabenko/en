it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written ‚Äî one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms ‚Äî or more rarely ‚Äî denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians II, 6-9) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians II, 6 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÑŒµŒªŒµŒØŒøŒπœÇ' - 'en tois teleiois' - <q>among the perfect ones; among the accomplished ones</q>. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians II, 7 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒØ·ø≥' - 'en mysterio' - <q>in mystery; in secret</q>. 'Œµ·º∞œÇ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ ·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'eis doxan hemon' - <q>for our glory; for glory of ours</q>. Here 'eis' indicates the goal, where the movement goes according to God's design.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians II, 9 ‚Äî 'Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ≤Œ∑' ‚Äî 'anebe' - <q>(where the heart of a human being did not) rise; climb; ascend</q>.
</p>
<p>
Paul before this said that the preaching of the apostles is not built on the ability to express oneself eloquently, but on truth, the action of the Holy Spirit, accompanied by various miracles and signs.
</p>
<p>
Here further he continues, saying that for the knowledge of such preaching, for seeing wisdom in it, one needs to be mature, to a certain extent perfect (not in the absolute sense as something special, extraordinary, but in the sense of <q>mature, who have reached a certain depth of life</q>, this is connected with knowledge and life according to the so-called <q>meaning, purpose of life</q>), for example, to know well the testimony of one's conscience.
</p>
<p>
Then he says that the wisdom of the apostles is from God ‚Äî the Lord intended to save people from ages. The Fathers explain thus, that the Son of God would have become incarnate in any case, because this is important for the divinization of people, for people to become children of God by grace.
</p>
<p>
And further Paul speaks precisely about deification and Jesus Christ, though he does not call it directly. This is seen from the above-mentioned word Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ≤Œ∑. That is, in joyful and solemn, magnificent states one can figuratively say that <q>the heart of a human being rises (climbs)</q>, and here Paul says that man never reached such a state as the Kingdom of God will be, such elevation from God.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew XXII, 15-22) </reading><br>
Matthew XXII, 15 ‚Äî '·ΩÖœÄœâœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÄŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ¥ŒµœçœÉœâœÉŒπŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ŒªœåŒ≥·ø≥' - 'hopos auton pagideusosin en logo' - <q>how to trap Him in word; so that to trap Him in word; so as to trap Him in word</q>. All variants of translation are possible.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXII, 16 ‚Äî '·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØ·æ≥' - 'en aletheia' - <q>in truth; truthfully</q>. That is how. 'Œµ·º∞œÇ œÄœÅœåœÉœâœÄŒøŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄœâŒΩ' - 'eis prosopon anthropon' - <q>into the face of people</q>. That is, you do not try to <q>fit into social perceptions</q>.
</p>
<p>
The cunning and feigned righteousness of those who asked became evident in their very question itself. If Christ is a Teacher from God (actually, is God Himself and Lord), then why did they want to test Him? Should they not obey? Tax ‚Äî this concerns a tax on the person himself or property, not certain fees for using something. In the times of Antiquity people perceived money as belonging to the ruler. Also the concept of <q>human rights</q> in the modern sense did not exist, although the Roman state was actually the first legal state in a sense close to the modern understanding. If a person gave such a tax for themselves, then they testified to their loyalty to the authority in the person of Caesar, actually showed by this their citizenship. And the Lord says to give what belongs to the state, society, and also what belongs ‚Äî to God. The order is important. First one needs to find out what belongs to whom, and then give. This means that this is always a question for investigation (to a certain extent), but at the same time Jesus's answer shows that the correct answer to it always exists, also it must be chosen and fulfilled. At the same time this clearly shows that the existence of authority as an institution corresponds to God's will.
