<p><reading>(Acts II, 22-36) </reading>
</p>
<p>Peter quotes prophecies about Jesus, all of which
concern Him first, but also concern people who live in the Lord by
virtue of their likeness to Christ and the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>Acts II, 26  &ndash; literally <q>my body will encamp (pitch a tent) in hope</q>
- that is, it will grow and fill the world in hope for God. The unnamed
(but perceived) <q>tent</q> refers to two adjacent and related, but somewhat
opposite images:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>it is a physical body; these words do not mean that there are two
bodies in a person, but that even the physical body of a person close to
God, full of hope, is spiritual, spiritualized, and reminds of Paradise
and the expulsion from it  &ndash; when God sewed clothes for people from the
skins of animals — about which I wrote more earlier, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02N6HkjRhPBNVKMCodXscJowpAV5DQkXxU4JmxJuZeuEWAk6nqjWZDtFcsQWeyjjoQl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02N6HkjRhPBNVKMCodXscJowpAV5DQkXxU4JmxJuZeuEWAk6nqjWZDtFcsQWeyjjoQl</a><br>
This is an image of the fact that even the purely physical life of such
a person takes place according to God’s hope, according to God’s
will.</p></li>
<li><p>this <q>heavenly body</q>, i.e. the resurrected one, which is similar
to the angelic nature in its properties, is glorified, because the
<q>heaven, close to the spiritual heaven, the firmament</q> (raqia) is also
compared to the <q>tent, tabernacle</q> in the Scriptures (Genesis I,
6-8).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these two images of Jesus indicate the properties of His
body, in particular after the Resurrection, but also in general from the
time of the Incarnation. And in relation to a person who is close to
God, these words refer to the unity of spiritual and physical life in
the person, to the spirituality of his / her life in the Lord.</p>
<p>This explains, in particular, the fact that Jesus ate fish and honey
after the Resurrection, although he did not need them. He passed through
a closed door and a tombstone, but you could actually touch Him.
Compare, for example, that Angels do not really eat (in the
non-canonical Old Testament book of Tobias, which survived only in the
Greek version, in the Septuagint), there is a mention that the Archangel
Raphael <q>pretended to eat</q> (but did not actually eat) (Tobias XII, 19),
and Christ actually ate, although He no longer needs it.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare the psalm quoted by Peter with the
Hebrew text — there are differences (this is Psalm XV (XVI), 8-11). In
particular, literally it sounds more like <q>Similar (equal) to the Lord,
(He) is always in front of me, therefore at my right hand  &ndash; I will not
waver</q>. Moreover, the end of the phrase roughly sounds like ‘mimini
bal-emmowt’. Here, in particular, the idea is important that in order
not to waver (‘bal-emmowt’), to be certain, it is necessary that the
Lord is on the right of somebody, close to the person. That is, you can
really achieve the state of <q>non-wavering</q> only from (through) the
Lord.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew text, there is no meaning of <q>tent</q>, there is simply
<q>to live</q>, <q>to dwell</q>. Peter, or rather the Holy Spirit, reveals more
fully the words of David.</p>
<p>Acts II, 28  &ndash; literally: <q>You will fill me with joy with
(accompanied, in the company of) Your face</q>  &ndash; that is, in communion with
God (here, judging by everything, first of all, the Father), in
communication, in love.</p>

<p><reading>(John I, 35-51) </reading>
</p>
<p><q>Lamb of God</q> is a reference to the Passover lamb,
whose blood the Israelites anointed their doorposts, and whose meat they
ate before leaving Egyptian slavery. John thus prophesies about
Jesus.</p>
<p>Two disciples  &ndash; Andrew the First-Called and John the Theologian
(according to general tradition, he was the second, unnamed
disciple).</p>
<p>When the Lord says (for example, giving the 10 commandments): <q>I am
the Lord your God, who brought you out of slavery in Egypt</q>, then the
entire Trinity  &ndash; Father, Son and Holy Spirit  &ndash; is indirectly mentioned
here.</p>
<p>John I, 42  &ndash; <q>son of Jonah</q>  &ndash; manuscripts differ here, in particular,
there are those that give <q>sonof John</q> (whom we do not know)  &ndash; that is,
the translation is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks in the future tense about Peter (the rock), that is,
later he will become like that.</p>
<p>The story of the vocation of Philip and Nathanael is well written at
