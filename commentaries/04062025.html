<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Acts XXIII, 11 — ‘ὡς γὰρ διεμαρτύρω τὰ περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, οὕτω σε δεῖ καὶ εἰς Ῥώμην μαρτυρῆσαι’ - ‘hos gar diemartyro ta peri emou eis Hierousalem, houto se dei kai eis Romen martyresai’ - ‘for, just as you have boldly and willingly testified about Me for Jerusalem, likewise it is necessary for you to testify for Rome’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates for whom Paul was to bear witness to the faith — in fact, here it has a dual meaning — Paul will be judged, but the state of people at God&amp;amp;#39;s true and righteous Judgment will also be determined by how they judged Paul, and with whom also they tried to judge Christ. Testimony about Christ in court is necessary to expose sin, as Christ says in the Gospels, and is the work of the Holy Spirit. Acts XXIII, 9 — ‘ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ’ - ‘en to anthropo touto’ - ‘in this human being; of this human being’. Where, in whom, of whom. There are various possible translations. The first two indicate that Paul was innocent in the opinion of this group, and the second - that they believed that he was not the leader of the evildoers, that is, he did not incite the people, but acted solely on his own behalf. Depending on this understanding, their general position will be different, but one thing is clear: if the Pharisees&amp;amp;#39; support in the controversial issue led them to decide to turn a blind eye to other previous accusations, then their position is clearly not impartial, and therefore the trial that took place was by no means righteous, even from the point of view of non-Christians."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Acts XXIII, 1-11) </reading><br>
Acts XXIII, 6 — ‘ἐν τῷ συνεδρίῳ’ - ‘en to synedrio’ - ‘in the Sanhedrin’. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXIII, 9 — ‘ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ’ - ‘en to anthropo touto’ - ‘in this human being; of this human being’. Where, in whom, of whom. There are various possible translations. The first two indicate that Paul was innocent in the opinion of this group, and the second - that they believed that he was not the leader of the evildoers, that is, he did not incite the people, but acted solely on his own behalf. Depending on this understanding, their general position will be different, but one thing is clear: if the Pharisees&#39; support in the controversial issue led them to decide to <q>turn a blind eye</q> to other previous accusations, then their position is clearly not impartial, and therefore the trial that took place was by no means righteous, even from the point of view of non-Christians.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXIII, 10 — ‘μὴ διασπασθῇ ὁ Παῦλος ὑπ’ αὐτῶν&#39; - <q>me diaspasthe ho Paulos hyp auton</q> - <q>Paul was not torn to pieces by them</q>.  The preposition ‘hypo’ in its form before the following vowel here is with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle phrase (in the original, the participle) ‘was torn to pieces’. The prudence of the commander. ‘ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν’ - ‘ek mesou auton’ - ‘from among them’. Where from. ‘εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν’ - ‘eis ten parembolen’ - ‘to the fortress; to the location of the military garrison’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXIII, 11 — ‘ὡς γὰρ διεμαρτύρω τὰ περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, οὕτω σε δεῖ καὶ εἰς Ῥώμην μαρτυρῆσαι’ - ‘hos gar diemartyro ta peri emou eis Hierousalem, houto se dei kai eis Romen martyresai’ - ‘for, just as you have boldly and willingly testified about Me for Jerusalem, likewise it is necessary for you to testify for Rome’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates for whom Paul was to bear witness to the faith — in fact, here it has a dual meaning — Paul will be judged, but the state of people at God&#39;s true and righteous Judgment will also be determined by how they judged Paul, and with whom also they tried to judge Christ. Testimony about Christ in court is necessary to expose sin, as Christ says in the Gospels, and is the work of the Holy Spirit.
