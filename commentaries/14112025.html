it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Thessalonians II, 14-19) </reading><br>
1 Thessalonians II, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te Ioudaia&#39; - <q>in Judea</q>. Where. &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; - <q>in Christ Jesus</q>. &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων συμφυλετῶν&#39; - &#39;hypo ton idion symphyleton&#39; - <q>by their own compatriots</q>. &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων&#39; - &#39;hypo ton Ioudaion&#39; - <q>by the Jews</q>. The prepositions &#39;hypo&#39; are here with the genitive case, indicate in both cases the passive state <q>suffered</q> and who caused those sufferings and tribulations.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 16 — &#39;εἰς τὸ ἀναπληρῶσαι&#39; - &#39;eis to anaplerosai&#39; - <q>in filling up; for filling up; so that thereby to fill up</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose of the action. &#39;εἰς τέλος&#39; - &#39;eis telos&#39; - <q>to the end; to (logical) completion</q>. By meaning — as a logical consequence of all the behaviour of the Jews, who opposed God and people.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 17 — &#39;ἀφ&#39; ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;aph hymon&#39; - <q>from you</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following &#39;hy&#39; indicates that the apostles and disciples here are in different places. &#39;ἐν πολλῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en polle epithymia&#39; - <q>in great desire; with great desire</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 19 — &#39;ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ παρουσίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te autou parousia&#39; - <q>at His Coming</q>.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul encourages the Thessalonians, showing their solidarity in everything with other Churches, in particular in Jerusalem, where the faithful first of all suffered persecutions and oppressions.
</p>
<p>
He speaks also about personal support, also about personal relations of the community with Paul.
</p>
<p>
Again he praises the faithful.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XI, 23-26) </reading><br>
Luke XI, 24 — &#39;ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου&#39; - &#39;apo tou anthropou&#39; - <q>from the human being</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that the unclean spirit completely goes out from the person. &#39;εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου&#39; - &#39;eis ton oikon mou&#39; - <q>into my house</q>. Where to. And a sinful person who leaves themselves without participation in the good, pure, holy, receives the name <q>house</q> for the unclean spirit, having become similar to him by the absence of good.
</p>
<p>
The parable in the context of the reproaches of the Pharisees about the unclean spirit in Jesus has such understanding that <q>the swept and tidied dwelling</q> quite may turn out to be the Pharisees themselves, and more generally — those people called by God who consciously reject Christ. Then there is nothing that could prevent even worse unclean spirits from acting on that environment and on each such person in particular, which the parable figuratively speaks about. At the same time such concrete understanding is fully generalised to the case of any conscious rejection of Jesus Christ and God in general. Then <q>empty house</q> means the absence of power which would not simply stop, but also drive away completely the evil spirits, so that they do not take possession of the <q>house</q>, that is, people. In the case of <q>swept house</q> only God&#39;s restraint and mercy does not allow even worse than is spoken in the parable (demons in reality are much more than seven).
</p>
<p>
Therefore the parable is for all a warning, and also a call to vigilance and alertness, to that so that <q>the enemy does not undermine secretly the house</q>, as it is spoken about that in another place.
