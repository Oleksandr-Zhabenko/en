it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(2 Thessalonians I, 10-II, 2) </reading><br>
2 Thessalonians I, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ’ - ‘en tois agiois autou’ - ‘in His saints; with His saints’. Since the glory of the saints does not increase the glory of God in essence, the first translation is preferable. ‘ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύσασιν’ - ‘en pasin tois pisteusasin’ - ‘in all believers’. Similar to the previous one. ‘ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ’ - ‘en te hemera ekeine’ - ‘on that day’. 
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 11 &mdash; ‘Εἰς ὃ’ - ‘Eis ho’ - ‘For what’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. ‘ἐν δυνάμει’ - ‘en dynamei’ - ‘in power; with power’. The second translation is preferable in terms of meaning.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 12 &mdash; ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘en hymin’ - ‘in you; by you; with you’. There are three possible translations: the first means that the faithful, being followers of Christ and bearing His name to a certain extent, living in accordance with God's will, will glorify God, the second means that the faithful themselves glorify God, and the third means that the name of Jesus is indirectly, passively glorified by the faithful because of that they are related to it. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in Him; by Him’. Both translations are possible and, in view of what has just been written, complement each other, saying that Christ glorifies the faithful.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians II, 2 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ μὴ ταχέως σαλευθῆναι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ νοὸς’ - ‘eis to me takheos saleuthenai hymas apo tou noos’ - ‘so that you do not quickly are shaken from the mind (way of thinking; worldview)’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates the purpose of the action, and the preposition ‘apo’ emphasises a certain degree of ‘leaving' one's mind (perhaps madness?) by those who think of the Kingdom of God on earth before the Second Coming.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark VIII, 22-26) </reading><br>
Mark VIII, 22 &mdash; ‘εἰς Βηθσαϊδάν’ - ‘eis Bethsaidan’ - ‘to Bethsaida’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 23 &mdash; ‘πτύσας εἰς τὰ ὄμματα αὐτοῦ’ - ‘ptysas eis to ommata autou’ - ‘having spit upon his eyes'. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of Jesus' action - towards the eyes that were sore.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 26 &mdash; ‘εἰς οἶκον’ - ‘eis oikon’ - ‘into the house’. ‘εἰς τὴν κώμην’ - ‘eis ten komen’ - ‘in the village; in the town’.
