<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Romans IX, 17 — &amp;amp;#39;ὅτι εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐξήγειρά σε ὅπως ἐνδείξωμαι ἐν σοὶ τὴν δύναμίν μου&amp;amp;#39; - &amp;amp;#39;hoti eis auto touto exegeira se hopos endeixomai en soi ten dynamin mou&amp;amp;#39; - for this very thing I raised you up, that I might show forth (manifest, make manifest and present, determining) My power in you.

it concerns God&amp;amp;#39;s permission, which in the Old Testament, and here also in the New Testament&amp;amp;#39;s quotation, people then did not distinguish from God&amp;amp;#39;s will. Therefore what God permitted Pharaoh to be cruel, is conveyed here by words that He raised him up. The translation raised up here is more precise, because it indicates that the Lord granted glory and honour to Pharaoh and Egypt earlier, so that later He might show His power so that people would have an example and believe in God&amp;amp;#39;s power. Instead the translation appointed, ordered, established is unsuccessful — it suggests the thought that the Lord supposedly incited Pharaoh to cruelty, which, of course, could not be. The Merciful Lord is not cruel, much less does He incite others to cruelty."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans IX, 6-19) </reading><br>
Romans IX, 6 — &#39;ἐξ Ἰσραήλ&#39; - &#39;ex Israel&#39; - <q>from Israel</q>. That is, descendants according to the flesh. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel here indicates that it concerns origin.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 7 — &#39;ἐν Ἰσαὰκ&#39; - &#39;en Isaak&#39; - <q>in Isaac</q>. In whom.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 8 — &#39;εἰς σπέρμα&#39; - &#39;eis sperma&#39; - <q>into seed; for seed</q>. That is, they are considered descendants with all consequences.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 8-9 verses speak about the significance of the promise. These words concern God&#39;s children. God promised an heir to Abraham — and precisely that child who was born from this promise, through it, as its fulfilment from God — precisely that one is <q>God&#39;s</q>, because truly from Him. And of course, God&#39;s is higher than human, therefore also higher than bodily.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 10 — &#39;ἐξ ἑνὸς κοίτην&#39; - &#39;ex henos koiten&#39; - <q>from one bed</q>. That is, these are Isaac&#39;s own children.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 11 — &#39;προθεσις&#39; - &#39;prothesis&#39; - <q>that which is placed before (particularly so were called the offering breads in the temple)</q>. It is often understood that God chose Jacob, and therefore he truly became Saint. But the matter is that God knew that precisely Jacob would be Saint, knew how he would exercise and would exercise his freedom, therefore, in no way limiting human freedom, God foresaw whom it was necessary to call and establish. Therefore the promises are given precisely to those people for whom they were important. See:<br>

&#39;οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἀλλ&#39; ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος&#39; — &#39;ouk ex ergon all ek tou kalountos&#39; - <q>not from works, but from the One Calling (that is from God)</q>. It concerns calling. The reason for calling people to the dignity of God&#39;s children after their fall is not their works, but God&#39;s will to save them, God&#39;s calling and response to it.
</p>
<p>
This is the general thought.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 13 — &#39;εμισησα&#39; - &#39;emisesa&#39; - <q>hated</q> — from &#39;μισεω&#39; - &#39;miseo&#39; - <q>to hate</q> (that is showed lesser love). Here it concerns <q>honoured less</q>, rather than <q>hatred</q>, because God does not hate His creation, but cares for it. Nevertheless, the blessing was given more to Jacob, and not to the elder Esau.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 14 — &#39;παρὰ τῷ θεῷ&#39; - &#39;para to theo&#39; - <q>in the vicinity of God; in God&#39;s presence</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the dative case and indicates here that it concerns the fact that drawing near to God means drawing near to truth, righteousness, but one can also say that drawing near to righteousness is drawing near to God.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 15 — a complex place for exact translation. Closest in meaning to: <q>I will show mercy to whom it is possible, and I will show compassion to whom compassion can be shown</q>. See also more about this:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0RoFbYVHa1KMRbSk9o1SkrxMjRzSqs3sg9DYBg6vMKYL3gqqB75zKWZApvyY4mr9ql">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/</a>
</p>
<p>
It concerns God&#39;s promises. God promises something important to people not because they want it, or strive for it, but because He is Merciful and Loving; God promises not through people&#39;s merits, but as a gift, nevertheless, to those who can preserve these promises and for whom they will truly be important.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 17 — &#39;ὅτι εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐξήγειρά σε ὅπως ἐνδείξωμαι ἐν σοὶ τὴν δύναμίν μου&#39; - &#39;hoti eis auto touto exegeira se hopos endeixomai en soi ten dynamin mou&#39; - <q>for this very thing I raised you up, that I might show forth (manifest, make manifest and present, determining) My power in you</q>. These are God&#39;s words concerning Pharaoh, who oppressed the Israelites before their exodus from Egypt. As I wrote recently, see particularly at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/26062025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/26062025.html</a><br>
it concerns God&#39;s permission, which in the Old Testament, and here also in the New Testament&#39;s quotation, people then did not distinguish from God&#39;s will. Therefore what God permitted Pharaoh to be cruel, is conveyed here by words that He <q>raised him up</q>. The translation <q>raised up</q> here is more precise, because it indicates that the Lord granted glory and honour to Pharaoh and Egypt earlier, so that later He might show His power so that people would have an example and believe in God&#39;s power. Instead the translation <q>appointed, ordered, established</q> is unsuccessful — it suggests the thought that the Lord supposedly incited Pharaoh to cruelty, which, of course, could not be. The Merciful Lord is not cruel, much less does He incite others to cruelty. &#39;ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ&#39; — &#39;en pase te ge&#39; - <q>in all the earth</q>. Where. That is, everywhere among people.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 19 — &#39;βουλήματι&#39; - &#39;boulemati&#39; - <q>will; counsel; purpose</q>. This word differs from that which properly means &#39;desire&#39; and &#39;will&#39;. Therefore here it is appropriate to speak not about God&#39;s will, but about His permission.<br>

<reading>(Matthew X, 32-36; XI, 1) </reading><br>
Matthew X, 32, 33 — &#39;Πᾶς οὖν ὅστις ὁμολογήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὁμολογήσω κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς&#39; - &#39;pas oun hostis homologesei en emoi emprosthen ton anthropon, homologeso kago en auto emprosthen tou patros mou tou en ouranois&#39; - <q>Therefore, everyone whoever confesses (recognizes, praises, acknowledges) Me before people, him I also will acknowledge before My Father Who is in the heavens</q>. The preposition &#39;en&#39; enters here into fixed expressions. About acknowledgement see at the link:<br>

<p>
Regarding relatives and Christ — often people put family, or more precisely their interests connected with close people, higher than God, in such a case they will hinder Christian life and/or faith. This is about such a situation that the Lord speaks here. Also possible are some other priorities which people will put higher than God — with the same result. The continuation is not read here, but in it Christ says what is right in such a case.
