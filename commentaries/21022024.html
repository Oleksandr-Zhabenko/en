Mark gives an example of Christ's recognition of an imperfect but correct understanding. Imperfect, because the Jewish lawyer did not recognise Jesus as the Messiah, but correct, because the Jewish lawyer understood in general terms the main point of the Law, the one he had studied diligently.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the psalm of King David, Jesus is the Teacher of the Law, the Prophet, being the <q>Son of David</q>, the Promised Messiah, the Son of God. This is one of the places in the Old Testament that clearly testifies to the Trinity. 
</p>
<p>
If we look deeper into the question of whether a descendant can be <q>Lord</q> &mdash; that is, Master, Lord - we see that there is also an opinion that &hellip; yes, it can be. And this denies the idea (which may have also been common among the Pharisees) that the Messiah would be a simple man and would have great glory and honour because of his descent from the house of King David, as an <q>inheritance</q> from his parents and forefathers. Christ refutes this idea here. He Himself became a human being, and did not inherit David's blessing, but blessed David. It also follows that if parents have a talented child, it is not from the parents that the child is talented, but from the Lord, from God. And if we understand that all good things that a person has come from God as a manifestation of God's love, then this passage of Scripture denies the idea that parents have full authority over their children because they are their offspring, denies the parents' <q>ownership</q> of their children's talents - and therefore, as a consequence, the ability to use those talents in arbitrary fashion.
</p>
<p>
No, children are God's gifts, and what children have of value is also God's gift. The blessing of parents is only effective if it is the blessing of God, if it comes from Him.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
