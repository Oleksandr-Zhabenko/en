it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Ephesians II, 4-10) </reading><br>
Ephesians II, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἐλέει’ - ‘en eleei’ - ‘in mercy; with mercy’. Both translations are possible, and both complement each other: the first emphasises that mercy is the general character of God, He is Merciful, and the second that God generously manifests various mercies.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en tois epouraniois en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in the above-heavenly places in Christ Jesus’. See the following links for more information on ‘in the above-heavenly places’ in Christ:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10102024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10102024.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16102024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16102024.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 7 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς αἰῶσιν’ - ‘en tois aiosin’ - ‘in the ages’. ‘ἐν χρηστότητι’ - ‘en khrestoteti’ - ‘in kindness; with kindness’. Similarly to the previous verse, in verse 4 both translations are possible and complementary. ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Christ Jesus; by Christ Jesus’. Both translations are possible, although the first is clearer and more common.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘ex hymon’ - ‘from you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates here the source of origin.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ἔργων’ - ‘ex ergon’ - ‘from works’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘e’ indicates here a substantial basis, answering the question ‘on what basis?’.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Christ Jesus; by Christ Jesus’. Both translations are possible, although the first one means that the Father is the Creator, and the Son is the Model, Pattern, Example, Purpose, Power of creating and creation, and the second one means that the Creator is the Son of God Himself. Actually, the Holy Spirit is also implied implicitly, as well. In general, the whole Trinity is the Creator, and each Person, Hypostasis, participates in His own way. ‘ἐν αὐτοῖς’ - ‘en autois’ - ‘in them’.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIV, 16-24) </reading><br>
Luke XIV, 18 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ μιᾶς’ - ‘apo mias’ - ‘from one; as one’. The meaning is the second version of the translation, i.e., they all began to deny the same way, just as one. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIV, 21 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς πλατείας καὶ ῥύμας τῆς πόλεως’ - ‘eis tas plateias kai rymas tes poleos’ - ‘into the streets and narrow roads of the cities’. These roads are ‘narrow’ because they are either narrow in themselves, i.e. alleys, lanes, or because they are filled with a crowd of people, making it difficult to pass. This nuance indicates that the Lord often calls people to Himself in difficult circumstances, and/or through special ‘places’ where several components ‘come together’, in other words, if people do not notice anything special about what is happening or their surroundings, then they are less likely to hear God's call.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIV, 23 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ φραγμοὺς’ - ‘eis tas odous kai phragmous’ - ‘into the roads and hedges’. This is a continuation of the previous thought that the Lord often calls in ordinary circumstances, and often in unusual or inconvenient ones. As a result, in all kinds of circumstances, in different ones, all the time.
