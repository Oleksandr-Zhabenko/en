it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XIV, 26-40) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XIV, 28, 35 — 'ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ' - 'en ekklesia' - <q>in the Church</q>. Where. 'ἐν οἴκῳ' - 'en oiko' - <q>in the house; at home</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 33 — 'ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῶν ἁγίων' - 'en passis tais ekklesiais ton hagion' - <q>in all the Churches of the Saints</q>. Where. Local Churches-communities of the faithful are meant.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 34 — 'ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις' - 'en tais ekklesiais' - <q>in the Churches</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 36 — 'ἢ ἀφ' ὑμῶν ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐξῆλθεν' - 'e aph hymon ho logos tou theou exelthen' - <q>or did the Word of God go out from you</q>. A question which reminds that the Corinthians received Christian faith from living witnesses, but were not witnesses themselves without the predecessors. 'εἰς ὑμᾶς μόνους' - 'eis hymas monous' - <q>to you alone</q>. Also they are not the only ones who received living testimony of faith.
</p>

Continuation of the theme, considered more at the links and others quoted there:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07082025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07082025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
If the understanding of why God created man first is above human understanding, then why Paul forbids women to preach (teach) at worship services can still be partially understood from the story about Eve and the fall.
</p>
<p>
I wrote about this earlier. Paul in his words refers to God and the devil (serpent), and from those two starting points explains why he says so. The devil tempted Eve because she was easier to tempt. This precisely explains the prohibition for women to preach at worship. When a man preaches, he more or less clearly understands where he says something <q>from himself</q>, whatever that means. In a woman everything can be <q>softer, more delicate</q>, and therefore it can be more difficult for her to distinguish where she speaks <q>from herself</q>. And this latter under certain conditions and circumstances (and therefore this must be necessarily taken into account) will lead to the fact that a woman may <q>introduce certain changes</q>. This affects the preservation of faith, and therefore Paul forbids doing this. Instead in all other cases there is no such prohibition.
</p>
<p>
For example, a woman can write sermons, as she can clearly think through beforehand what is what; a woman can preach not at worship, among women there are even co-apostolic women, particularly Mary Magdalene; there are helpers of apostles, for example, Mary, sister of apostle Philip, there are enlighteners of whole peoples, particularly saint co-apostlic Nina, enlightener of Georgia; there are holy women who taught Fathers of the Church, particularly saint Macrina, sister of saint Gregory of Nyssa, about which he himself testifies; there is finally the Mother of God, Who also preached; Scripture mentions women-prophetesses, particularly Anna and others, and, of course, forbids nothing similar.
</p>
<p>
Scripture even gives examples when it was necessary for a male prophet to obey a donkey that spoke, and also other examples, particularly to learn from ants and bees.
</p>
<p>
Regarding <q>spirits of prophets</q> I mentioned in a good work:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a>
</p>
<p>
<q>commandment of the Lord</q> — it is unclear what is meant at all (whether this concerns Jesus, or this concerns the Old Testament, and which particular commandment: concerning the preaching of women or that one should understand what is being preached).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew XXI, 12-14, 17-20) </reading><br>
Matthew XXI, 12, 14 — 'εἰς τὸ ἱερόν τοῦ θεοῦ' - 'eis to hieron tou theou' - <q>into the temple of God</q> (the one which was in Jerusalem). Where to. 'ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ' - 'en to hiero' - <q>in the temple</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 17 — 'εἰς Βηθανίαν' - 'eis Bethanian' - <q>to Bethany</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 18 — 'εἰς τὴν πόλιν' - 'eis ten polin' - <q>to the city</q> (Jerusalem). Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 19 — 'ἐν αὐτῇ' - 'en aute' - <q>in it; on it</q>. Actually, in Ukrainian the second variant grammatically. Where. 'ἐκ σοῦ' - 'ek sou' - <q>from you</q>. The preposition 'ek' here indicates origin. 'εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα' - 'eis ton aiona' - <q>forever; for ever</q>. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Christ shows His power as King.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the den of robbers there is a good prayer: <q>Lord, grant us that our hearts be houses of faithfulness, and not dens of robbers!</q>
