<reading>(Colossians I, 2-6) </reading><br>
Precedes and continues today's reading from the Apostle, having in common with it verse 2, the one I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24102023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24102023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Colossians I, 2, 3 &mdash; 'ημων' - 'emon' - 'us' (our). 'προσευχόμενοι' - 'proseukhomenoi' - 'praying high, lifted up, with inspiration'.
</p>
<p>
Colossians I, 6 &mdash; 'ἡμέρας' - 'emeras' - (of the) 'day'.
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul calls Christ Himself, Whose Coming the faithful await, as well as all the benefits that the Lord grants, including and mainly those associated with His Coming and the Kingdom of God, <q>the hope prepared in the heavens</q>. 
</p>
<p>
The gender agreement in the ancient Greek indicates that it is not <q>hope has come to you</q>, because hope is feminine, but <q>the Gospel has come</q>, meaning that the apostolic preaching, the Gospel, had spread throughout the world and reached the Colossians before the time of the epistle. Paul is writing to the Colossian Christians. The Colossians had come to know, learned to discern, to recognise God's grace in truth. This is an indirect indication that the Christians in Colossae were mostly looking for truth and &mdash; unconsciously - grace before they came to know Christianity, but they found them and cognised them in Christ.
