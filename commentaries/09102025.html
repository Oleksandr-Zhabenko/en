it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.

<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Ephesians V, 33-VI, 9) </reading><br>
Ephesians VI, 1 &mdash; 'ἐν κυρίῳ' - 'en kyrio' - <q>in the Lord</q>. That is, <q>when parents say in the Lord, according to God's will</q>. If parents say something contrary to God's will, then one does not need to do what they say.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 2 &mdash; 'ἐντολὴ πρώτη ἐν ἐπαγγελίᾳ' - 'entole prote en epangelia' - <q>commandment first in promise; first commandment in promise</q>. The preposition 'en' indicates here the direct dependence between fulfilling the commandment and long and good life.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 4 &mdash; 'ἐν παιδείᾳ καὶ νουθεσίᾳ κυρίου' - 'en paideia kai nouthesia kyriou' - <q>in the discipline and admonition of the Lord</q>. That is, one needs to nurture, discipline and admonish (guard, protect) by reminding in the Lord.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 5 &mdash; 'ἐν ἁπλότητι' - 'en haploteti' - <q>in simplicity</q>. That is, simplicity of heart promotes the fear of God, about which more is written at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539152859716654/?multi_permalinks=3554517061513547">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539152859716654/?multi_permalinks=3554517061513547</a>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 6 &mdash; 'ἐκ ψυχῆς' - 'ek psykhes' - <q>from the soul; out of the soul</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here the origin of action — from where. See also regarding the commandment of love, which has a direct connection here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15042025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10112024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10112024.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05022025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05022025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 8 &mdash; 'παρὰ κυρίου' - 'para kyriou' - <q>from beside the Lord</q>. The preposition 'para' here with genitive case. A similar expression is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and also regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more about this at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/02082025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/02082025.html</a><br>
Here this indicates that there is a parallel with the fact that the gifts of the Holy Spirit were received by different people — both slaves and free, and also that God's giving of good is similar and also connected with the Lord's giving of the Holy Spirit. Not for nothing in the Gospels, when Christ speaks of God's giving in response to prayer, in Matthew it is spoken of good gifts, and in Luke — of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians VI, 9 &mdash; 'ἐν οὐρανοῖς' - 'en ouranois' - <q>in heavens</q>. 'παρ' αὐτῷ' - 'par auto' - <q>in the vicinity of Him</q>. The preposition 'para' is here with dative case, indicates that the view of people regarding their person, status in society etc. is not characteristic to God, God looks at people differently.
</p>
<p>
Generally Paul in the reading teaches respect and honour for people, regardless of their position by virtue of personal or social relations and conditions, circumstances. For parents and children are connected by personal relations, and master and slaves — by social ones, predominantly through social structure. Both examples (as also all intermediate between them) are directed to correctly understanding that they are equal before God, that the Lord is Lord (Master) over all, that fulfilling God's will is more important than social position. More about the attitude to slavery I wrote regarding another passage, see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/23072025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/23072025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
One can also say that what the apostle here warns against, that is a manifestation precisely of disrespect. The faithful are called not only to respect, but also to love, but deep true love is impossible without respect for the dignity of another person, as also one's own also.
</p>
<p>
Also Paul speaks of the fact that labour which is not sin needs to be performed diligently, sincerely, wholeheartedly, with faith.
