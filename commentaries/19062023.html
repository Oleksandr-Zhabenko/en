<p><reading>(Romans VII, 1-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans VII:6  &ndash; ‘καινοτητι’  &ndash; ‘kainoteti’ -
‘newness, novelty’. ‘παλαιοτητι’  &ndash; ‘palaioteti’  &ndash; ‘oldness,
obsolescence’.</p>
<p>Romans VII, 8, 13  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; ‘me’.</p>
<p>Romans VII, 10  &ndash; ‘ευρεθη’  &ndash; ‘heurethe’  &ndash; <q>having been discovered,
found, taught</q> (commandment).</p>
<p>This is a difficult passage to understand, consisting of two
parts.</p>
<p>In the first part, Paul is talking about the scope of the Jewish Law
(as long as a person is alive).</p>
<p>When a person dies, their freedom changes. More about this (with some
theological and philosophical terminology) can be found in the work
here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="19052023.html">19052023.html</a></p>
<p>So Paul says that to be truly free from being under the Law, one must
die to sin with Christ. Then what the law is for will be fulfilled
through Christ, and thus there will be no need to be <q>under the law</q>.
This does not mean that the person will become lawless (and Paul says
this later, and earlier, and in other Epistles), but instead of a
literal understanding of the Law of Moses with its rites, prototypes,
and so on, the person will live in truth and freedom from sin in Christ,
which is what he or she is really called to do.</p>
<p>And if they do not, then for such people the Law is a guide to
Christ, which to a certain extent warns, cautions, teaches, wises, and
so on, all to save the weak person from falling. But this is the
weakness of the human being, that without Christ they cannot be saved by
the Law.</p>
<p>Paul speaks very clearly about how sin <q>becomes exceedingly sinful</q>
when the Law is already in place. But, as I wrote earlier, in order to
overcome a real temptation, it must first be recognised as such, become
manifest instead of secret, and then be overcome. If a temptation can be
overcome without this, then it is not actually real. This is the reason
why the Lord gave the Law  &ndash; although people are not saved through the
Law, it reveals sins and temptations (the first and necessary step to
victory).</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IX, 36  &ndash; X, 8) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew IX, 36  &ndash; ‘εσπλαγχνισθη’ -
‘esplanchnisthe’  &ndash; ‘being moved with compassion’.</p>
<p>The election of the 12 apostles and their instructions. Some of the
apostles on the list had two names, so the lists in the synoptics differ
somewhat (one evangelist gives one name and another the other).</p>
<p>The instructions say that the apostles have a special mission, a
task, and therefore, in addition to all the commandments, they have
special commandments for their work. The important thing is that in this
way more people should be brought to salvation and the knowledge of the
truth.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
