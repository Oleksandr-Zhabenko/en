it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Ephesians II, 19-III, 7) </reading><br>
Ephesians II, 20 — 'θεμελιω' - 'themelio' - <q>foundation</q>.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 21, 22 — 'ἐν ᾧ' — 'en ho' - <q>in Whom</q>. 'εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον ἐν κυρίῳ' - 'eis naon hagion en kyrio' - <q>into holy temple in the Lord</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates movement and development — where to.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 21 — 'συναρμολογουμενη' - 'synarmologoumene' - <q>assembled together from separate parts to form one whole</q>.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 22 — 'συνοικοδομεισθε' — 'synoikodomeisthe' - <q>you are built together from different materials</q>. Thus Paul emphasises that the earthly Church is formed by different people, with different histories. 'εἰς κατοικητήριον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν πνεύματι' - 'eis katoiketerion tou theou en pneumati' - <q>into dwelling of God in the Spirit (by the Spirit)</q>.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians III, 2 — 'εἰς ὑμᾶς' - 'eis ymas' - <q>into you; for you</q>. Rather the second by meaning. Paul received the gift of grace not in the Gentiles, and not in Christians who were formerly Gentiles, but for them, to bring them to Christ. 'οικονομιαν της χαριτος' - 'oikonomian tes kharitos' - <q>stewardship (</q>economy<q>) of grace</q>. One could say <q>dispensation of grace</q>. Paul means that the apostles (and also their successors) received grace <q>for application to the building up of the Church, to the growth of the faithful in God</q> (including the apostles themselves and their successors).
</p>
<p>
Ephesians III, 3 — 'ἐν ὀλίγῳ' - 'en oligo' - <q>in few; briefly</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians III, 4 — 'ἐν τῷ μυστηρίῳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ' - 'en to mysterio tou CHristou' - <q>in the mystery of Christ; by the mystery of Christ</q>. Paul means that his understanding is partial regarding the entire mystery of Christ, which is greater than any human understanding, as if <q>encompasses</q> Paul's understanding, which reveals its part.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians III, 5 — 'ἐν πνεύματι' - 'en pneumati' - <q>in the Spirit; with the Spirit</q>. Both translation variants are possible, with the first indicating the abiding of the apostles and prophets in the Holy Spirit, and the second the manner of Revelation — revealed through the Spirit Himself.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians III, 6 — 'ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ' - 'en CHristo Iesou' - <q>in Christ Jesus</q>.
</p>
<p>
A dense passage, therefore many words and expressions above. I will comment briefly.
</p>
<p>
About <q>household members of God</q> a parable about the Trinity and Christ is well written at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/Parable.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/Parable.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Paul calls <q>the mystery of Christ</q> the participation of the faithful from all nations in God's plan for the salvation of people through Christ. Actually, to the spreading of faith in Christ among different nations his apostolic work was dedicated. Therefore here is a significant part of Paul's personal position.
