<p><reading>(Isaiah VIII, 13  &ndash; IX, 7) </reading>
</p>
<p>The text, which has different possible
translations, also the Greek and Hebrew texts are different.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will dwell only on the mentions of it in the New
Testament (and there are several of them), as well as general
thoughts.</p>
<p>About fear, freedom and the fear of God, there is a good work at the
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02qW9br79NQToB5FNCYBacyKqh4PTqLFhgaxhL4gorZF2YGZFQ1oTFnV9zUq9afkLdl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02qW9br79NQToB5FNCYBacyKqh4PTqLFhgaxhL4gorZF2YGZFQ1oTFnV9zUq9afkLdl</a></p>
<p><q>Here I am and the children whom God has given me,</q> are the words of
the faithful, but also above Isaiah wrote that the Lord gave him a son,
who was symbolically named in connection with the attack of the
Assyrians. These words are quoted by the apostle Paul (Hebrews II, 13).
If the Lord gives parents children, it is a sign of hope that the Lord
gives mercy.</p>
<p>Next, Isaiah exposes diviners and conjurers of the spirits of the
dead (modern spiritualists).</p>
<p>Isaiah IX, 1  &ndash; quoted in Matthew IV, 15-16, in connection with the
beginning of the preaching of Jesus Christ after the Baptism by
John.</p>
<p>And then the prophecy about the Coming of the Messiah  &ndash; Jesus Christ,
in particular also Isaiah IX, 6. Here the Greek text of the Septuagint
gives a brief, and the Hebrew is more extended. <q>Wonderful, Counselor,
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace</q>  &ndash; symbolic names that
mean a lot, among others, in particular  &ndash; Prince of Peace  &ndash; <q>High Priest
forever after the order of Melchizedek</q>, <q>Mighty God</q>  &ndash; the very name
Jesus means — <q>The Lord is salvation.</q> Everlasting Father (of Eternity),
because <q>by Him the ages were created.</q> <q>Wonderful Counselor</q> is a
reference to the conception of the judge Samson, when the Angel answered
that he had a strange name, also that <q>Christ is God’s Power and God’s
Wisdom</q>, which Paul says, that is, about <q>the power of God, which is
exercised in weakness.</q></p>
<p>I once wrote a poem where there is an allusion to these words in the
original  &ndash; <q>Wonderful Interlocutor</q>  &ndash; and it was primarily about the
prayer of meek people.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis VI, 9-22) </reading>
</p>
<p>The text is about Noah and God’s decision to flood
the earth.</p>
<p>Geologists confirm that in the history of the Earth in many places
there was a period that can be associated with this flood. See in
particular:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc---3">https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc—3</a></p>
<p>In the New Testament, we have more details, in particular, that
people lived and did not care about God, matters of faith, godliness,
virtues, and in the text itself, that they <q>corrupted their every way</q>
(except for Noah and his family), that is, they did everything and
thought wrongly, badly.</p>
<p>In such a society, it was very difficult for unconfirmed people who
did not have firm faith, as at the opposite patriarch Noah had it, to
come to know the truth, therefore such a society was destroyed by God.
Along with those people, animals also suffered. But the Lord saved the
elect.</p>
<p>Regarding the flood itself, oh, God grant me to write later
about.</p>
<p>The Lord warns us against everything that those people sinned
against.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
