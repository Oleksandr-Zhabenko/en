At the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah XIII, 2-13) </reading><br>
Isaiah XIII, 10 &mdash; 'kowkbe' - <q>stars</q> - from 'kokab' - <q>star</q>. In Hebrew, masculine.
</p>
<p>

<p>
At Vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis VIII, 4-21) </reading><br>
Genesis VIII, 8-12 &mdash; 'hayyownah' - <q>dove</q> - from 'yonah' - <q>dove; pigeon</q>. In the Hebrew language, it is feminine.
</p>
<p>
The dove knew that it was necessary to bring Noah a sprig of olive (olive &mdash; masculine in Hebrew) because of the action of God's grace.
</p>
<p>
In general, the dove with an olive branch has become a symbol of peace and the Holy Spirit. The image is taken from here.
</p>
<p>
There is also an indirect meaning here, a symbol &mdash; the olive branch was brought for the second time out of three. On the third time, the dove did not return at all, having found good land. In fact, the first time the dove was forced to return because there was no place good enough; the second time it brought the olive branch, which already showed that it was good; and the third time it got complete freedom and did not return, heralding the time of complete <q>deliverance</q> from the ark and the flood. The image of the middle of the three shows that God often operates in a special way in the state of creation between necessity and complete arbitrariness. It is also an image of productive, fruitful activity - if a person does something only out of the necessity, it is not productive and fruitful; if they do it out of complete arbitrariness, without regard to the needs of others, it is also not productive; only activity that is directed to others, that is not done out of necessity, creative activity is more blessed by God like the branch.
