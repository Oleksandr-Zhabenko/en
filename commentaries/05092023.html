<p><reading>(2 Corinthians XII, 20  &ndash; XIII, 2) </reading>
</p>
<p>A direct continuation of
yesterday‚Äôs reading:
<br><a class="link2" href="04092023.html">04092023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Paul writes that distrust to the apostles leads the congregation to
various divisions, quarrels, anarchy, and this in turn leads to falling
into various sins. While the apostle can arrive, the distrust can have
far-reaching consequences, which Paul would have to eradicate in sorrow
and humiliation (as a person who has not succeeded in what they strived
for).</p>
<p>Paul goes on to say that he will restore discipline in the community
and will not be lenient.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark IV, 24-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark IV, 27  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±ŒΩ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòemeran‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòday‚Äô.</p>
<p>Mark IV, 31  &ndash; ‚Äòkokko‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòkernel, grain‚Äô  &ndash; from ‚Äòkokkos‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòkernel,
grain‚Äô.</p>
<p>Verse 24 is referred to in the parallel passage in Matthew VII, 2:
<br><a class="link2" href="17062023.html">17062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Verse 25 is referred to in the parallel passage in Matthew:
<br><a class="link2" href="10072023.html">10072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Next comes a unique parable that is found only in Mark.</p>
<p>The man is like the Kingdom of God; the seed is what the Lord wants
people to do for the Kingdom of God while living in this age; the land
that gives fruit is people who have accepted what the Lord wants and are
doing it; the reapers are angels; and the harvest is the Second Coming
of Jesus Christ. It is said that man does not know how the earth gives
birth  &ndash; it means that people need to make efforts to do God‚Äôs will, the
way of applying efforts now, in this age, is significantly different
from the way of life in the Kingdom of God, where there will be no
difficulties, temptations and sins, and therefore these efforts are
called <q>by itself</q> <q>the earth bears fruit</q> (it depends on people
themselves whether they will do God‚Äôs will). But we need to remember
that although the method is different, God‚Äôs grace is always needed for
people to fulfil God‚Äôs will, and it is not directly mentioned here (but
implied).</p>
<p>In this way, the parable shows, through the example of the growth of
the wheat, God‚Äôs overall purpose for the Kingdom of God and what the
faithful do in this purpose.</p>

Coincidence of the name of the prophet Zechariah the Serpent Visionary
(Zechariah I, 1) and Zechariah, the father of Saint John the Baptist
(both or just the first of them may be mentioned in the reading
itself).</p>
