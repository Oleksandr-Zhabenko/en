it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Colossians II, 13-20) </reading><br>
Colossians II, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ μέσου’ - ‘ek tou mesou’ - ‘from within; of the inside’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν παρρησίᾳ’ - ‘en parresia’ - ‘in boldness; openly; with everything said; confidently’. These are words with many meanings. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in that; in it’. Some translations do not translate it.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐν βρώσει’ - ‘en brosei’ - ‘in food; in rest’. ‘ἐν πόσει’ - ‘en posei’ - ‘in drink’. ‘ἐν μέρει ἑορτῆς’ - ‘en merei heortes’ - ‘in regard to the feast’. 
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ’ - ‘en tapeinophrosyne’ - ‘in humility; with humility’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that (imaginary) humility is constantly manifested, and the second that it is the driving force behind such actions. ‘ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς’ - ‘ypo tou noos tes sarkos’ - ‘under the mind of the flesh; through the mind of the flesh’. That is, being misled by their minds, which are corrupted and darkened by sin.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐξ οὗ’ - ‘ex hou’ - ‘from Whom’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hou’ indicates the Source of growth.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 20 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων’ - ‘apo ton stoikheion’ - ‘from the elements’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises the freedom from the elements of the world through dying with Christ. ‘ἐν κόσμῳ’ - ‘en kosmo’ - ‘in the world; by the world’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating a life in the world, and the second indicating that such a life is governed by the rules of the sinful world.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XVII, 20-25) </reading><br>
Luke XVII, 20 &mdash; ὑπὸ τῶν Φαρισαίων - ‘ypo ton Pharisaion’ - ‘under the Pharisees; through the Pharisees’. The preposition ‘ypo’ here, with the genitive case, indicates that the question was arrogant and somewhat like an interrogation.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 24 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῆς ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν εἰς τὴν ὑπ’ οὐρανὸν' - <q>ek tes ypo ton ouranon eis ten yp ouranon</q> - <q>from (a place) under heaven to ( a place, possibly another place) under heaven</q>. That is, ‘under the heaven’, but in a wide range, on a large scale. ‘ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ’ - ‘en te hemera’ - ‘in the day’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 25 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς’ - ‘apo tes genes’ - ‘from the generation’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises that people will renounce completely, entirely.
