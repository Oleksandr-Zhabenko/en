it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians XIII, 3-13) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians XIII, 3 — &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - &#39;en emoi&#39; - <q>in me</q>. In whom. That is, the Corinthians tried to know whether the apostle acts according to the will, teaching, love, truth of Christ, that is, whether Paul in all this is truly His representative. One needs to understand several important moments here. Firstly, they believed in the reality of Paul&#39;s apostleship itself, particularly among them. Secondly, they believed in Christ Himself. The question only arose whether those decisions that Paul himself made, whether they are such as Christ wants to see them. The apostle earlier showed examples of the action of the Holy Spirit and Christ in him, therefore reminds the faithful to remember that they themselves are Christ&#39;s. The task of the apostle is not that they should always when needed seek his decisions, but that they should learn to act according to Christ. &#39;εἰς ὑμᾶς&#39; - &#39;eis hymas&#39; - <q>for you; towards you</q>. That is, the Corinthians already have experience and testimony of life in Christ, which encourage them to move and grow further. &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - &#39;en hymin&#39; - <q>in you; among you</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XIII, 4 — &#39;ἐσταυρώθη ἐξ ἀσθενείας, ἀλλὰ ζῇ ἐκ δυνάμεως θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;estaurothe ex astheneias alla ze ek dynameos theou&#39; - <q>crucified from weakness, but living from the power of God</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; (also in the form &#39;ex&#39;) indicates here an important cause — Christ could be crucified as man, but He is also living as God Almighty. &#39;ἐν αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en auto&#39; - <q>in Him</q>. Here are polysemous words — weak both because they suffer for Christ, and because they have their human weaknesses. &#39;ἐκ δυνάμεως θεοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς&#39; - &#39;ek dynameos theou eis hymas&#39; - <q>from the power of God for you</q>. It is spoken here about the grace of the Holy Spirit granted to the faithful.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XIII, 5 — &#39;ἐν τῇ πίστει&#39; - &#39;en te pistei&#39; - <q>in the faith (Christ&#39;s, true)</q>. &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - &#39;en hymin&#39; - <q>in you</q>. It is spoken both about perichoresis, and about that what is done by the faithful Christ accepts as done to Him personally, and about that the faithful are the Church, which is the Body of Christ.

</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XIII, 9 — &#39;καταρτισιν&#39; - &#39;katartisin&#39; - <q>teaching, perfection</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XIII, 10 — &#39;εἰς οἰκοδομὴν καὶ οὐκ εἰς καθαίρεσιν&#39; - &#39;eis oikodomen kai ouk eis kathairesin&#39; - <q>for house-building and not for destruction (ruining)</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XIII, 12 — &#39;ἐν ἁγίῳ φιλήματι&#39; - &#39;en hagio philemati&#39; - <q>in holy kiss; with holy kiss</q>. I wrote earlier in more detail, see at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07092025.html  ">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07092025.html  </a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Kiss.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Kiss.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Verse 8 means <q>for truth, for the sake of truth</q>. The strength of the apostles is in the truth itself, therefore this strength is both for it, and for its sake, but in no way against it.
</p>
<p>
Paul in verse 9 writes that he writes about judgement then, to make the matter of judgement in time. Also here is testimony that the apostle&#39;s judgement is directed towards edification and resolution, and not towards destruction.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion — wish of communion with the whole Trinity — enters into the text of the Divine Liturgy.
