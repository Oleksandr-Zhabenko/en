<p><reading>(Hebrews VI, 9-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>Before these words (which are thus somewhat <q>taken
out of context</q>), Paul compared the state of people who learned the
truth of faith, reached the heights, and then fell away and,
unrepentant, perish, with the state of a barren, but cultivated and
well-kept land, arable land. Comparison with inanimate nature allows you
to <q>judge</q> boldly (because there is no presence of someone), but,
returning to people, Paul constructs the words accordingly, since the
readers have already agreed with him that God’s judgment is just, if we
understandably judge the earth in a similar way.</p>
<p>And then he again encourages the faithful ones and encourages them to
keep faith, to be patient in order to receive the promises.</p>
<p>Someone will say: <q>Is it not possible to receive desired promises
from God without endurance and patience?</q>. But the meaning and power of
faith is not in patience itself, but in life with Christ, in Christ, in
the Holy Spirit, in God. Yes, even when you have to suffer and show
endurance.</p>
<p>If this seems somewhat <q>wrong</q>, then let’s think about this example:
imagine that a person does not want to be friends, for example, saying:
I may face difficulties in friendship, I may be left, and what will I
do? But these words mean that he / she is not thinking about all the
good things that he / she will get or can get from the friendship, but
only about the possible bad consequences. That is, to put it simply: he
/ she avoids failure, instead of trying to succeed.</p>

</p>
<p>Mark VII, 32  &ndash; the word παρακαλουσιν is used again
- here <q>asked</q>, which is generally multi-meaningful, in particular it
means <q>to comfort</q>, <q>encourage</q>, from which the name of the Holy Spirit
comes  &ndash; Comforter, Paraclete.</p>
<p>The Gospel contains an extraordinary amount of details of the actions
(compared to other places), which were witnessed by the apostle Peter
(he was standing not far from the place of action). Probably, he was
very surprised at how Christ healed the sick, and also because Peter,
after Pentecost by the power of the Holy Spirit, performed many
miracles, raised the dead, granted to walk (together with John) in the
Name of Jesus, but not it is known whether a deaf and dumb person was
ever healed by him as Jesus had done here.</p>
<p>It must also be said that Mark emphasizes the human nature of Jesus,
the fact that He is a perfect human, most of all the evangelists.</p>
<p>The ask to not publicize a miracle is so that people do not build
their faith (only) on miracles, because then the word of Jesus itself
would be left without proper treatment (He would be listened to less,
and more people would want new miracles).</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul writes about the state of the resurrected on the
basis of mainly knowing the Risen Lord and Savior Jesus Christ through
His appearance and Revelation to him personally, as well as under the
action and inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In this regard, the following can also be said (I wrote this on
Easter 2022): <q>Christ,</q>being resurrected, no longer dies”, <q>death has no
power over Him</q>, in the words of the apostle. Together with death, all
the dependencies of human nature disappeared, in particular He could
<q>pass through the sealed stone</q> of the tomb without breaking the seal,
<q>through the closed door</q>, He no longer needs food and drink (although
He ate to convince the disciples of the reality of the resurrected
body), does not need sleep, does not grow old and changes for the worse.
<q>The Lord reigned, clothed Himself in beauty, girded Himself with
strength</q> (Psalm 91 (92)), says the Psalm about His body, calling the
human nature of the Son of God the <q>beauty and power</q> of God. This is
due to the deification of human nature and hypostatic <q>association of
the properties</q> of the two natures. The apostle testifies to
the <q>manifestation of the freedom of the glory of the God’s
children</q> — this citation corrected on the 05/01/2024 — Christ’s glory is free to act. 
<q>Eye has not seen,
and ear has not heard, and it has not occurred to the heart of man what
God has prepared for who loves Him</q>. Similarly, the faithful, after the
general resurrection, which is a consequence of the Resurrection of
Christ, will change, but will have different glory.”</p>
<p>Here I will also emphasize that the imitation of the damage of human
nature as well as its renewal do not require that we are required to be
born bodily as descendants of Adam, but takes place in a mysterious way,
which Paul here calls an <q>image</q> (εικονα).</p>

<p>The apostle emphasizes that people have victory over sin and death,
over corruption and everything that contradicts God’s design for
creation, not through the works of the Law, but through the Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
