<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Proverbs XIII, 9 — ‘πλανῶνται ἐν ἁμαρτίαις’ - ‘planontai en hamartiais’ - ‘wandering in sins; wandering among sins’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that wicked people in their souls (and therefore in their lives) do not know the right way and ‘miss the mark’ in various ways, and the second - that sins themselves, mistakes and failures themselves become the living environment of such people. Proverbs XIII, 2 — ‘ἀπὸ καρπῶν δικαιοσύνης φάγεται ἀγαθός’ - ‘apo karpon dikaiosynes phagetai agathos’ - ‘from the fruits of righteousness (justice, justification) they will eat benefits’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the benefits in question are a gift from God, and that they are not entirely deserved, but are received by God&amp;amp;#39;s mercy and generosity. Genesis IX, 19 — ‘ἀπὸ τούτων διεσπάρησαν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν’ - ‘apo touton diesparesan epi pasan ten gen’ - ‘from these they were scattered like grain over the whole earth’. That is, people settled down being descendants of Noah&amp;amp;#39;s sons. In general, it is not clear whether the ‘earth’ refers to the area where the flood took place or to some other area. Proverbs XIII, 3 — ‘ἐν ἐπιθυμίαις’ - ‘en epithymiais’ - ‘in lusts; in covetousness’. In other words, inaction develops covetousness and leads to sins. ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ’ - ‘en epimeleia’ - ‘in cares; in attentions (to something or someone)’. In other words, a good person is attentive to what they are doing, and their attention prevails over strong passions."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.

In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah XXVI, 21-XXVII, 9) </reading><br>
Isaiah XXVI, 21 — ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁγίου’ - ‘apo tou hagiou’ - ‘from the holy’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is the Lord Who reveals Himself to people in this way and that it is His gift.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVII:4 — ‘ἐν ἀγρῷ’ - ‘en agro’ - ‘in the field’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVII, 5 — ‘ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘enoikountes en aute’ - ‘those dwelling in it’.

At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis IX, 18-X, 1) </reading><br>
Genesis IX, 18 — ‘ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ’ - ‘ek tes kibotou’ - ‘out of the ark’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates where they came out of after the flood.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IX, 19 — ‘ἀπὸ τούτων διεσπάρησαν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν’ - ‘apo touton diesparesan epi pasan ten gen’ - ‘from these they were scattered like grain over the whole earth’. That is, people settled down being descendants of Noah&#39;s sons. In general, it is not clear whether the ‘earth’ refers to the area where the flood took place or to some other area.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IX, 21 — ‘ἔπιεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου’ - ‘epien ek tou oinou’ - ‘drank of the wine’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that the intoxication actually comes from drinking wine. ‘ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ’ - ‘en oiko autou’ - ‘in his house’. Here it means being protected by shelter from wind and bad weather.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IX, 24 — ‘ἐξένηψεν δὲ Νωε ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου’ - ‘exenepsen de Noe apo tou oinou’ - ‘Noah returned to sobriety out of (after) the wine&#39;. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Noah became sober by getting rid of the alcohol in his blood, i.e. it was not the wine that made him sober, but the absence of drinking it for a certain time.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IX, 27 — ‘ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις τοῦ Σημ’ - ‘en tois oikois tou Sem’ - ‘in the houses of Shem’. That is, in the settlements of his descendants.

<p>
<reading>(Proverbs XII, 23-XIII, 9) </reading><br>
Proverbs XII, 24 — ‘δόλιοι δὲ ἔσονται εἰς προνομήν’ - ‘dolioi de esontai eis pronomen’ - ‘the deceitful will be made a prey (for tribute)’. There are options for translation, but in general, the preposition ‘eis’ indicates what deceit leads to.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XII, 28 — ‘ἐν ὁδοῖς δικαιοσύνης’ - ‘en hodois dikaiosynes’ - ‘in the ways of righteousness; in the ways of justice’. That is, ‘where’. ‘εἰς θάνατον’ - ‘eis thanaton’ - ‘unto death’. That is, ‘where to’.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIII, 1 — ‘ἐν ἀπωλείᾳ’ - ‘en apoleia’ - ‘in destruction; in ruin; in loss’. That is, suffering loss or even collapse.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIII, 2 — ‘ἀπὸ καρπῶν δικαιοσύνης φάγεται ἀγαθός’ - ‘apo karpon dikaiosynes phagetai agathos’ - ‘from the fruits of righteousness (justice, justification) they will eat benefits’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the benefits in question are a gift from God, and that they are not entirely deserved, but are received by God&#39;s mercy and generosity.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIII, 3 — ‘ἐν ἐπιθυμίαις’ - ‘en epithymiais’ - ‘in lusts; in covetousness’. In other words, inaction develops covetousness and leads to sins. ‘ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ’ - ‘en epimeleia’ - ‘in cares; in attentions (to something or someone)’. In other words, a good person is attentive to what they are doing, and their attention prevails over strong passions.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIII, 7 — ‘ἐν πολλῷ πλούτῳ’ - ‘en pollo plouto’ - ‘in much wealth’. 
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIII, 9 — ‘πλανῶνται ἐν ἁμαρτίαις’ - ‘planontai en hamartiais’ - ‘wandering in sins; wandering among sins’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that wicked people in their souls (and therefore in their lives) do not know the right way and ‘miss the mark’ in various ways, and the second - that sins themselves, mistakes and failures themselves become the living environment of such people.
