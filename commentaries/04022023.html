<p>Glory be to Jesus Christ!

<p>There were two readings today, one of which was dedicated to the Apostle Timothy.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke X, 1-15) </reading>
</p>

<p>In particular, the teaching of Jesus to the 72 apostles is read in the Gospel devoted to the apostle. The Lord says that <q>the worker is worth of his / her maintenance.</q></p>
<p>These words apply not only to the apostles, in particular, clergymen often live on donations. And every person who really works for the glory of God has a result is worthy of his / her support and feeding in the eyes of God. Someone will say that for this a person must be a saint, work miracles. But look, the words of Jesus about the support of the worker sound before the words about miracles, that is, they are independent of them. The Lord does not say: <q>Behold, you will work miracles, and then you will be worthy...hellip;</q>, but <q>the worker is worthy.</q> Who works? The one who is primarily interested in the result, who brings the fruit.</p>

<p><reading>(2 Timothy II, 11-19) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Apostle was read the science of preserving what was accepted from the apostles, against the heresy that the general resurrection has already happened, against useless arguments, but calls for purification and knowledge of God.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XVIII, 2-8) </reading>
</p>

<p>The parable of the widow and the unrighteous judge was read from the daily Gospel. As Luke XVIII, 1 says, it is for that we never lose heart and do not cease to pray, even if there is no quick answer to our prayers. About the judge. In the Law of Moses, it is said that judges should judge fairly, and in particular also orphans and widows â€” where there is a fair opportunity, should provide for their protection (as for the most unprotected). The judge did not do this for a long time. He <q>kept his position</q>, and the opinion of God and people did not interest him. Very often such self-minded people who occupy a certain position oppose the faith; here it is emphasized that the widow was right, and the judge had to protect her according to the Law, and because he did not want to, he was called an <q>unrighteous judge.</q> As for God, indeed, He is not like this judge, and answers prayers not under compulsion, but voluntarily, from good will (moreover, He Himself firstly leads us to such good prayers by His grace). God always gives people gifts voluntarily, even if people sincerely and long asked for them. God does not always give good gifts <q>instantly, quickly</q>, in particular, so that we show strength of spirit in persevering, and strive for the sake of the Lord. Our diligence in our relationship with God, sincere burning, are close in importance in the matter of our salvation to God's gifts. And by the <q>certain distance</q> of the answer from the request, God wants to cause greater diligence and burning in us, and therefore to give greater joy at the time of fulfillment. If a person asks for something that the Lord knows will be harmful to his / her salvation and the salvation of others, then He restrains it out of love. Therefore, since the gift of the Holy Spirit is necessary for salvation, Luke writes that it is necessary to ask for it, and then the Lord will give it.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
