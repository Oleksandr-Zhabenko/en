<p><reading>(Isaiah LVIII, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>Isaiah LVIII, 1  &ndash; <q>a voice like a trumpet.</q>
There are good works about the trumpet (trumpet) at the following links:

<p>Isaiah foresees the Gospel truths about fasting and prayer, charity,
which Christ teaches in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew VI).

<a class="link2" href="26022023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">26022023.html</a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that Isaiah speaks more sharply, he has more
exposure, while Christ speaks wisely. The difference becomes clearer if
we remember that Christ is the Savior and Isaiah is the servant.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis XLIII, 26-31; XLV, 1-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Again, much of Jacob’s story is
left out, including his dealings with Laban, his reconciliation with
Esau, his story with Dinah and her brothers, genealogies, the beginning
of Joseph’s story, his dreams, the jealousy of his brothers and their
selling him into slavery in Egypt, how the Lord helped Joseph in Egypt,
so that he became the second person after Pharaoh, and saved people from
hunger, about the arrival of his brothers for bread. Omitted (to keep
the reading short) is the story of the trial of the brothers and how
they repented of what they had done to Joseph before their father Jacob
and God.</p>
<p>The reading itself mainly talks about Joseph’s conversation with his
brothers, their forgiveness and mutual reconciliation, as well as about
God’s Providence, thanks to which the Lord directed the evil done to
Joseph in such a way as to do good to all of them.</p>
<p>In this regard, Joseph is a (proto)type of Christ, the Savior of the
world, and his story is a (proto)type of the Passion, Death and
Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Genesis XLV, 8  &ndash; <q>So it was not you who sent me here, but God! And he
made me…</q>  &ndash; important words so that people do not boast before God.
Literally, so that the brothers would not attribute to themselves the
merits of Joseph, that it was because of them that he became great, but
no  &ndash; not because of them, but because of God, Who magnified the
righteous Joseph  &ndash; and did it for them all, for common salvation.
Similarly, in other such stories, sinful people (and even devils!)
cannot boast that their sins supposedly contributed to God’s good.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs XXI, 23  &ndash; XXII, 4) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Greek and Hebrew texts differ
greatly for a few verses, especially Proverbs XXI, 30  &ndash; which I believe
says that the Lord is Most High, so nothing that is against Him really
matters.</p>
<p>In general, the Lord through Solomon teaches to pay attention to
one’s own desires (compare with the 10th or 9th and 10th commandments),
righteousness, mercy, compassion, selflessness, the ability and desire
to present as a gift and give (a manifestation of love), warns against
hypocritical religiosity, shamelessness, testifies to the fact that the
Lord gives people good things, in particular delivery and a good
victory, teaches that a clear conscience and good reputation are more
valuable than profits and wealth, reminds of the community between
people before God and speaks about the value of the fear of God.</p>
<p>There is a good essay about the fear of God at the link:

<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
