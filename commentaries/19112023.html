<p>
Here I will write about verses 14-18.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians II, 14 - 'á¼¡Î¼á¿¶Î½' - 'emon' - 'us'.<br>
</p>
<p>
In these verses (14-18) Christ is called <q>our Peace</q>. First of all, Paul testifies that Christ has brought salvation to all people, not only to the Israelites in the flesh, but through His Passion, Death and Resurrection He has reconciled people to God. <br>

has more to say about the suffering and redemption in Christ, but this one is about the peace that people have received in Christ, Who humbly became a human being, descended to Hades to save people.<br>
</p>
<p>
Christ suffered not only for Israel, but for all people, because crucifixion was not a punishment in the Law - Christ voluntarily accepted for the salvation of people such suffering - crucifixion - which was not provided for in the Law of Moses as a punishment for sin, but which was used by the Gentiles. Christ did this to save all people.<br>
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XII, 16-21) </reading><br>
The reading of the parable was previously omitted in the reading at the link, but is read today:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/06112023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/06112023.html</a><br>
</p>
<p>
The parable is about the fact that a person can become carried away with material things, forgetting about God, and the fascination with their own material well-being can prevent them from even helping other people. Then the death of such a person or the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will reveal that what they have unreasonably appropriated is not actually sufficient for eternity, and material goods themselves will often not be distributed in a way that would please that person. <br>
</p>
<p>
Verse 21 is more literally translated as: <q>so it is with everyone who lays up treasures for themselves, and does not become rich in (the direction, as a destination, aim) of God.</q><br>
</p>
<p>
The generalised reference to <q>everyone who</q> indicates the generality of the situation described - it applies to everyone, not just those who have actually experienced this.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ encourages us to be concerned first and foremost about life with God. <q>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and all other things will be added to you,</q> He says in another Gospel.<br>
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
