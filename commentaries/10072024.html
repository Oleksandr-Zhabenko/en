<reading>(Romans VIII, 2-13) </reading><br>
Romans VIII, 3 &mdash; 'διὰ τῆς σαρκός' - 'dia tes sarkos' - 'through  the body'. Because of the weakness of human nature after the fall, the law does not save human beings. 'περὶ ἁμαρτίας κατέκρινεν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἐν τῇ σαρκί' - 'peri amartias katekrinen ten amartian en te sarki' - 'concerning (because of; for) sin, He condemned sin in the body'. He condemned sin because it is sin, literally a <q>miss</q>, a failure to hit God's target.
</p>
<p>
Romans VIII, 7 &mdash; 'ἔχθρα εἰς θεόν' - 'ekhthra eis theon' - 'enmity in (as the final destination) (against) God' - the preposition 'eis' indicates the dynamism and tendency of enmity against God - it is not always obvious that carnal thought, sinful thought is enmity against God and His purpose, often it does not come to the point of detection, but the meaning is exactly that - enmity against God, against Him, even if it is not obvious to the extent that it can be clearly detected. <br>
'οὐχ ὑποτάσσεται' &mdash; 'oukh (h)ypotassetai' - <q>is not placed under; is not subject to</q> God's law. <q>Cannot</q>, i.e. <q>is not able, has no power</q> - because due to the previously mentioned <q>laws of sin and death</q>, a person cannot obey God's Law in a state of sin, it is mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Romans VIII, 11 &mdash; 'ζῳοποιήσει' - 'zoopoiesei' - 'to make alive', 'to create, as poetry, actively alive'. I wrote more about the meaning of the word earlier, see the link:<br>

This means that the life given by the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, will extend to the body. If a person lives according to the Holy Spirit, He will revive even their body.
</p>
<p>
A direct continuation of yesterday's reading, with which it has one verse in common. See the link, in particular the use of the word <q>law</q>:<br>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew X, 16-22) </reading><br>
Matthew X, 17 &mdash; 'ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων' - 'apo ton anthropon' - 'from people'. The use of the preposition 'apo' indicates <q>apart</q> from people, i.e. the life of the apostles should not be completely <q>transparent</q> and predictable by people. In general, their behaviour should be open and trustworthy, but at the same time it should not be simple-minded, careless, thoughtless, inattentive, indifferent, etc.
</p>
<p>
Matthew X, 22 &mdash; 'ὑπὸ πάντων διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου' - 'hypo panton dia to onoma mou' - 'under all (from all; by all) because of (as a 'channel' or means of action; here it is actually the 'cause' of people's hatred) My name'. People will hate the faithful, in particular the active ones, because of the name of Christ. The name itself will be something that the world will not accept. Perhaps the world will accept Jesus' teachings, history, and so on, but not Him as Christ, as Saviour, as Lord and God, and so on. The world will try to avoid entering into a relationship with Christ Himself (although this is impossible, people are all in a relationship with Christ in one way or another, it is just a question for each person - in what way). The situation is similar to the conspiracy of the criminal vineyarders in the Parable of the Heir Apparent.
