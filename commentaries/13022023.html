<p><reading>(1 John II, 18&ndash;III, 10) </reading>
<br>

A continuation of the 1st epistle of John the Theologian was read from the daily apostle, where the apostle writes about antichrists, about knowledge of God and truth, and about love. There are various explanations why John writes about antichrists in this way, in my opinion, he reminds us of the simplest example  &mdash; you can often recognize a deceptive person from simple things. Many deceptive people accept (declare) faith in Jesus and the Father, but if they do not even do this basic thing, then, wanting to teach others spirituality, is actually an example of delusion, one (several) of many.</p>
<p><q>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know everything &hellip; and that anointing teaches you in all things and is true and infallible</q>  &mdash; it refers to the gifts of the Holy Spirit (many people relate these words to the Sacrament of Anointing). Someone will say: <q>But I do not have all the knowledge that I would like to have</q>  &mdash; but it is open to human the true way of knowing the truth, not deceitful, non-deceptive, effective, and knowledge itself in any case also requires our work. We cannot call our knowledge what we have received, but in no way made our own, did not accept. It cannot be considered our knowledge also that what we did not think through, did not appreciate, did not apply in any way. And if all this requires time, certain efforts, more or less, then why be surprised that the open path with all God's help is already called <q>knowledge</q>? After all, the well with clean water can be called <q>water</q>, although it still needs to be scooped up from there in a certain vessel or at least with hands (lips).</p>
<p><q>do not need anyone to teach you</q>  &mdash; someone else, not from Jesus or contrary to Him. Having come to know Christ, there is no need to look for another, supposedly <q>better</q> teacher.</p>
<p><q>we will see Him as He is</q> â€” that is, at His Coming, in the Kingdom of God, the faithful will be able to perceive God directly as the children of their parentsâ€”not containing everything, but containing enough. Someone may try to deny that this is <q>too much</q> for man as a limited being, but let me remember the Mother of God, the Immaculate Virgin, Who not only knew Jesus perfectly, but also gave birth to Him in the flesh. If this was possible for Her, then for all of God's children the vision of God as He is is quite possible and will be in reality.</p>
<p>Further, <q>children</q> indicate the source of origin not of the essence, but of life, behavior, thoughts, words, etc. About the rebirth, which is also mentioned in the Gospel, there is a good essay at the link:<br>

<p><reading>(Mark XI, 1-11) </reading>
<br>
From the daily Gospel, we read about the glorious Entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. I will dwell on only two details. Jesus borrows a donkey through the apostles to enter Jerusalem. Not the richest and not the most glorious animal, and even borrowed for one day  &mdash; a sign that the Lord can and often wants to show (and does) His glory even where no one expects it, where the circumstances do not favour it. At the same time, the entry itself and the celebration last all day until the evening. The Lord does all this for the sake of us and our salvation, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah (Zachariah IX, 9), and we see that the Lord does not reject glorious long celebrations, while the limit of His glorious entry was the whole day, only until the evening. This reminds us that human glory has a limit. Following Christ, Christians remember moderation.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
