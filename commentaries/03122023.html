<reading>(Ephesians V, 9-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>
Ephesians V, 16 &mdash; 'Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±Œπ' - 'emerai' - 'days'.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I wrote earlier about this reading. I quote:
</p>
<p>
<q><br>
The science of Christian life and the fight against passions and sins was read from the Apostle. The image of light needs explanation because it can be misunderstood. 
</p>
<p>
Ephesians V, 13-14 (beginning) is translated into English as: </q>But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light‚Äù. Instead, a more literal translation brings out the details and allows the passage to be understood. 
</p>
<p>
<q>But everything that is exposed (condemned, becomes clear with reproach) under the light becomes visible, because everything that becomes visible is light.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>becomes visible, is light</q> ‚Äî refers to the phenomenon of light reflection by objects that do not emit their own light and are visible in the reflected light. This includes most objects and beings that we see, including people themselves. That is, it means that if you place an object under the light, then any object (not counting absolutely black bodies, which are very few in nature among ordinary non-self-luminous objects) will begin to reflect and scatter part of the light, which may be enough to illuminate something else. For example, this is how the sky is illuminated at dawn or dusk (the predominant mechanism there is light scattering, but also with similar consequences). This reflected part of the light is also light, just reflected (its polarization and intensity change, as well as the spectrum, but that's a separate topic).
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Paul means that if someone exposes sin and unrighteousness with truth and virtue, then in the light of truth and virtue they become visible as sins and vices, as deception and untruth, and this visibility is also necessary to see everything clearly. At the same time, exposed sin is not a virtue and does not become one, just as untruth does not become truth. But their revealing then serve to establish truth and virtue.
</p>
<p>
<q>under the light</q> &mdash; that is, if the revealing and judgment takes place by the grace of God, it is right, if sin and unrighteousness take the right place of the low in this.
</p>
<p>
