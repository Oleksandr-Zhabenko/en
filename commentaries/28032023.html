<p>(Isaiah XL, 18-31) Here Isaiah prophesies, comparing God and
creation, first showing the insignificance of idols (very relevant words
in times of widespread polytheism, but also considering spiritual idols,
they are always relevant), then comparing the strength of people and God
- testifying to the greatness of God and that He will strengthen His
people.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the reading is very eloquent and is often quoted by
poets and artists in particular.</p>
<p>(Proverbs XV, 7-19) The Greek and Hebrew texts differ markedly, but
are generally very similar.</p>
<p>Through Solomon, the Lord teaches wisdom, self-control, meekness,
kindness, cheerfulness, hard workingness, and willingness (eagerness) to
learn. He also warns against the opposites of these - from madness,
intemperance, anger and quarrels, cruelty, sadness that does not come
from love for God and neighbors, for oneself (it harms the spirit,
spiritual life), laziness and unwillingness to learn.</p>
<p>He also confesses that the Lord is the Seer of the Heart, knows
everything.</p>
<p>Speaks of the superiority of wisdom and righteousness over
foolishness and wickedness.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
