<p><reading>(Acts XIV, 6-18) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts XIV, 8  &ndash; ‘κοιλιας’ from ‘koilias’  &ndash; ‘womb,
abdomen, belly’.Acts XIV, 13  &ndash; ‘στεμματα’ from ‘στεμμα’  &ndash; ‘stemmata’ led
‘stemma’  &ndash; ‘wreaths, garlands’.</p>
<p>Acts XIV, 17  &ndash; ‘εμπιπλων’  &ndash; ‘empiplon’  &ndash; from ‘εν’ + ‘πλειστος’ -
‘in’ + ‘fill’  &ndash; ‘filling in’, also can be ‘satisfying’.</p>
<p>Paul’s miracle, such as the one read this Sunday, triggers a
religious, but not Christian, reaction to start honouring the apostles
as pagan gods, with respect to their worship and offerings. Paul, having
the word, denies this false veneration, testifies to the God who allowed
the nations to <q>go their own ways</q>.</p>
<p>Paul’s miracle, such as the one read this Sunday, triggers a

<p>Paul, having the word, denies this false veneration, testifies to the
God who allowed the nations to <q>go their own ways</q>, that is, allowed
them to live without the Law of Moses, while still caring for them, and
now performed a miracle through people like them with the same feelings
as the audience and listeners of the sermon.</p>

<p><reading>(John VII, 14-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VII, 16  &ndash; ‘Εμη’  &ndash; ‘Eme’  &ndash; ‘Mine’. ‘εμη’ -
‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Mine’.</p>
<p>John VII, 17, 28  &ndash; ‘εμαυτου’  &ndash; ‘emautou’  &ndash; ‘Myself’.</p>
<p>John VII, 23  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John VII, 26  &ndash; ‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘openly, boldly,
confidently, freely, all-outspokennessly, frankly’.</p>
<p>John VII, 28, 29  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used only with
emphasis.</p>
<p>Christ is teaching the people in the temple on a feast day openly,
but they do not understand Him secretly considering about the plot to
kill Him, doubt whether He is really the Christ, and have their own
thoughts about the Messiah.</p>
<p>Christ reveals the fact that they do not accept Him, and their plans
to kill Him.</p>
<p>Just like similar miracles and explanations in the synoptic Gospels,
where Christ healed on the Sabbath and said that <q>the Son of Man is Lord
of the Sabbath,</q> He says here that it is possible to heal and save
people on holidays. He gives the example of circumcision and emphasises
the inaccuracies in the Jews’ understanding to show that they do not
understand Him either.</p>
<p>The ideas that the Jews need salvation and <q>do not know God</q> in the
sense that they are preparing for serious sin are also important.</p>
<p>It is also important because Christ says that the person who truly
loves God will draw closer to Jesus, to the truth.</p>
<p>In general, the meaning of Jesus’ words is that those who sincerely
sought God and the truth accepted Him, and did the right thing, while
other people rejected Him and did not realise the seriousness of their
situation.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there was still time for the Jews to
realise what Christ was doing and saying, and Who He was.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
