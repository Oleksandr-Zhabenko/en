it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Luke XVIII, 35 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἱερειχὼ&#39; - &#39;en to engizein auton eis Hiereikho&#39; - <q>when He was approaching Jericho</q>. &#39;παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν&#39; - &#39;para ten hodon&#39; - <q>to the proximity with the road</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the accusative indicates that the blind man sat closer to the road, in order to have the possibility to ask passers-by for alms.

In general here one sees the example of the faith of a physically blind person, which has parallels in all the Gospels. The very appeal of the blind man to Jesus is the first form of the well-known Jesus Prayer (since <q>Son of David</q> is the promised Messiah, in Greek this will also be <q>Christ</q>). It is necessary to note that a similar confession of faith we see also in Peter, the publican, the Canaanite woman.

<reading>(Luke XVII, 12-19) </reading><br>
Luke XVII, 12 — &#39;εἴς τινα κώμην&#39; — &#39;eis tina komen&#39; - <q>into some village; into a village</q>. Whither. That is, the name of the village is not given here.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ὑπάγειν&#39; — &#39;en to hypagein&#39; - <q>in the going; during the going; when they were going</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 15 — &#39;εἷς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν&#39; — &#39;heis de ex auton&#39; - <q>one of them</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates here the representation of a group of several persons.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 16 — &#39;παρὰ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;para tous podas autou&#39; - <q>to the proximity with His feet</q>. That is, as close as possible to Jesus&#39;s feet. A sign of humility, great respect and gratitude. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the accusative.
</p>
<p>
The healing by Jesus of the ten lepers. Jesus fulfils the Law of Moses, impels to do the same also those ill with leprosy, whilst the filling of the actions of the Law becomes their faith in Christ. It is with this faith that salvation comes. But this same faith impels one of them not only to fulfil what is necessary according to the Law, but to go further and having returned, to give glory to God, that is, to glorify both Christ and God through Him. And it is precisely such faith, which <q>goes further</q> — up to the knowledge of God Himself, that also saves that healed leper.
</p>
<p>
Also it is necessary to note, as the interpreters remark, that <q>your faith</q> — implicitly it is meant <q>He in Whom believes</q> the person, that is, Christ Himself. Not faith itself as a state, but He to Whom it is directed. For it is not the state and not works that save the person, but Christ Himself, the Lord Himself. And even the name of Jesus — <q>the Lord is salvation</q> — eloquently says that it is not faith that saves, but the Lord Himself, in Whom the person believes.
</p>
<p>
Also an example that God&#39;s miracle is still not sufficient for salvation, for salvation requires in the proper sense not the state of things, the state of affairs, the situation, and not even the body of the ill person and so forth, but the person themselves personally, wholly, therefore even the evident manifestation of God&#39;s glory, God&#39;s action, God&#39;s grace, God&#39;s bestowal — if the person does not unite with this, then it does not lead them to salvation. But if they unite — then it leads.
</p>
<p>
Also here we see a lesson of gratitude, in particular for God&#39;s benefactions.
