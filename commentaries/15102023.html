<p><reading>(Luke VIII, 5-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>There is a well-known Parable of the Sower with
explanations by Jesus Himself. I will say here that Luke’s version of
the parable is somewhat abbreviated, but it is clear that he understands
this parable as a description of the process of ripening and bearing
fruit. Not everyone successfully completes this process to the end,
although everyone has been included in it, at least to a small extent,
and everyone is called to this maturation in the Lord. The description
shows what common obstacles are possible to the successful completion
and the bearing of much fruit. This understanding is indicated, in
particular, by the words of Luke VIII, 14-15, where the words
‘τελεσφορουσιν’  &ndash; ‘telesphorousin’  &ndash; ‘not reaching maturity’, ‘υπομονη’
- ‘ypomone’  &ndash; ‘patient endurance, which requires time, persistence’.</p>
<p>In general, the parable and its explanation are very similar to
similar passages in Matthew (Matthew XIII, 1-23) and Mark (Mark IV,
1-20), which can be found here:
