<p><reading>(Romans XI, 2-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans 11:4  &ndash; ‘εμαυτω’  &ndash; ‘emauto’  &ndash; ‘to
Myself’.</p>
<p>Verse Romans XI, 11 reveals Paul’s true attitude towards the
Israelites  &ndash; ‘fall’ means ‘to collapse, to disappear, to lose all
significance’. No, the Israelites, although many of them rejected
Christ, did not collapse. The faith had spread among the former
Gentiles, so that the Israelites themselves could be converted to Christ
through them in particular.</p>
<p>In other words, Paul speaks of God’s Providence, God’s permission -
no, the Lord does not want Israel to perish, even though they rejected
Him, but He wants them to repent, and since this takes time, the Lord
spreads salvation through faith in Christ to all nations.</p>
<p>The quotes from the Old Testament reflect the fact that the people of
the Old Testament did not distinguish between God’s will and God’s
permission, so that what the Lord permitted unwillingly they often <q>put
into God’s mouth</q> as if He wanted it. No, God does not want the sinner
to die, does not want cursing.</p>
<p>About the <q>remnant by election of grace</q>  &ndash; the Jews are not
completely deprived of salvation, but the Lord, by His will, continues
to care for them in order to bring at least some of them to repentance
and salvation. And for this to happen, it is necessary that the person
be receptive to faith and grace, and not <q>locked in the letter of the
law</q>. That is, a deep spiritual life is needed.</p>
<p>It remains to some extent a mystery in the relationship between God
and people, who chooses whom: grace  &ndash; people or people  &ndash; grace.
Apparently, this refers to the cooperation of God and people in
salvation, synergy  &ndash; if it exists, if people respond well to the action
of grace, then they can be part of the <q>remnant</q>.</p>
<p>I have written more about this in several works, see the links:

<p><reading>(Matthew XI, 20-26) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XI, 23  &ndash; ‘εμεινεν’  &ndash; ‘emeinen’ -
‘remained’.</p>
<p>Matthew XI, 26  &ndash; ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before, in the face
of’.</p>
<p>For more information about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well
as the general logic of why it will be more tolerable for them, see this
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="20062023.html">20062023.html</a></p>
<p>If those who rejected the apostles of Jesus Christ cannot stop on the
path of spiritual degradation without repentance, then this is even more
true of those who rejected Christ Himself when He performed great
miracles and was a perfect Example.</p>
<p>Therefore, repentance cannot be treated indifferently or considered
as something insignificant or unimportant  &ndash; no, it is one of the main
things in the work of human salvation.</p>
<p>To Saint Michael, the first Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus:
(Hebrews VII, 26  &ndash; VIII, 2; John X, 9-16) On the readings from the
Apostle, see:
