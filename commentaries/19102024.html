<reading>(1 Corinthians XIV, 20-25) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XIV, 21 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ νόμῳ’ - ‘en to nomo’ - ‘in the Law’. ‘ἐν ἑτερογλώσσοις καὶ ἐν χείλεσιν ἑτέρων’ - ‘en heteroglossis kai en kheilesin heteron’ - ‘in other languages and in other mouths; by other languages and by other mouths’. Both translations are possible, although the second is more direct and therefore more appropriate, since it refers to God's desire to be heard by people for their salvation and eternal life.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 22 &mdash; ‘εἰς σημεῖόν’ - ‘eis semeion’ - ‘as a sign; for a sign; in a sign’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose here: ‘for what purpose’.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 24 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ πάντων’ - ‘hypo panton’ - ‘under all; through all’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case and means that judgement and reproach seem to ‘come’, become part of a person's life through other people. The peculiarity of human perception. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIV, 25 &mdash; ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘en ymin’ - ‘in you’.
</p>

<reading>(Luke VII, 1-10) </reading><br>
Luke VII, 1 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς ἀκοὰς’ - ‘eis tas akoas’ - ‘into hearing; for hearing’. It indicates the purpose for which Christ spoke. ‘εἰς Καφαρναούμ’ - ‘eis Kapharnaoum’ - ‘into Capernaum’.
</p>
<p>
Luke VII, 6 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τὴν στέγην’ - ‘hypo ten stegen’ - ‘under the roof'. Here the preposition ‘hypo’ is with the accusative.
</p>
<p>
Luke VII, 8 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ ἐξουσίαν’ - ‘hypo exousian’ - ‘under the authority’. ‘ὑπ’ ἐμαυτὸν' - <q>hyp emauton</q> - <q>under me myself</q>. Here the preposition ‘hypo’ is with the accusative. I wrote earlier about the parallel passage in Matthew: <br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/21072024.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/21072024.html</a><br>
The accusative is used with the preposition ‘hypo’ or its form before the vowel ‘hyp’, which indicates subordination here, and more precisely in the context of the centurion's words, a certain ‘functional coherence regardless of desires’. Let me explain the last statement in more detail. The centurion is ‘under the authority’ means that he performs some of the functions of the authorities, such as protection and control, while the higher meanings of human existence, such as freedom, are not revealed here. The same is true for the centurion's soldiers &mdash; they carry out his orders, performing his functions to a certain extent, and the higher meanings of human existence are not revealed here either. This is the reason for the centurion's humility. In fact, what he means is that he recognises the honour of taking Jesus in, and he recognises that his life does not take place in the higher meanings of human existence. In his eyes, Jesus is the One Who came for them.
</p>
<p>
Luke VII, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ’ - ‘en to Israel’ - ‘in Israel’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke VII, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν οἶκον’ - ‘eis ton oikon’ - ‘into the house’.
