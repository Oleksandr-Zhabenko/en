<p><reading>(Romans V, 10-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Continuation of the thought expressed by the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="14042023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">14042023.html</a></p>
<p><q>Reconciled</q>  &ndash; literally <q>changed mutually, came to a compromise,
exchanged</q>. It means that Christ died in our place (exchange), and this
made people and God alike in Christ (brought them closer together,
became <q>like a compromise</q>). The meaning of <q>reconciliation</q> is derived
from the general meaning of the passage. The Sacrifice of the Son of God
became the Sacrifice of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Romans V, 12 is a difficult passage to understand and translate. A
more accurate translation might be <q>death passed in that all have
sinned</q>. That is, sin is the <q>conductor</q> of death, figuratively
speaking, the <q>channel</q> through which death came. But the difficulty
arises when we compare it with verse 14, in which the translation
roughly gives: <q>from Adam to Moses, even over (direction of distribution
- where?) those who did not sin in (presence in, state in) the likeness
of Adamâ€™s transgression.</q> We can conclude from these two verses that sin
became the conduit and the doorway to death, but then death does not
exist in itself in full accordance with sin. That is, it has spread (or
at least is capable of spreading) to those who have not sinned (the most
vivid example is Jesus Christ).</p>
<p>Paul goes on to speak of the gift of grace through the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ in comparison to the fall of Adam. This gift is much
greater because it covers many trespasses and sins.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VIII, 23-27) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew VIII, 23  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î²Î±Î½Ï„Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜embantiâ€™ -
â€˜having enteredâ€™  &ndash; from â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î²Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜embainoâ€™.</p>
<p>The story of the calming of a storm at sea. The disciples are amazed,
and the Lord teaches them to have faith through a miracle. If the Lord
is with human beings, then they should not be afraid of different
circumstances.</p>
<p>The disciples are called <q>of little faith</q> because the Lord gives
them faith and they do not hold it. See more about this at this link
(for the fourth verses, but also for the whole work):

<p>I would also add that the fact that this was a miracle and not a
natural phenomenon is emphasised by the great silence that followed,
instead of the unstable weather after a violent storm (which would have
been the natural course of strong atmospheric changes).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
