<p><reading>(Acts IX, 32  &ndash; 42) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts IX, 38  &ndash; ‘παρακαλουντες’  &ndash; ‘parakalountes’ -
‘imploring’.</p>
<p>Continuation of the story of the work of the Apostle Peter. The
healing of Aeneas is in harmony with the healing of the man who was
lying down at Bethesda, which is read from the Gospel today. The second
miracle is the resurrection of the righteous virgin Tabitha, who, on the
occasion of the reading, also has a memorial day (she is a saint,
righteous, as is evident from the description given to her in the
passage).</p>
<p>Peter does these miracles by the action of the Holy Spirit, that is,
it is the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ through the Apostle
Peter who performs these miracles.</p>
<p>We can see a similarity with the raising of a dead young man by the
prophet Elijah (but the Old Testament prophet had to pray several times
and touch the body of the young man, although the bones of the prophet
Elisha who received the <q>double prophetic gift</q> of Elijah after him,
resurrected the dead man through the <q>accidental</q> (but in fact  &ndash; by the
will of God) touch of the dead body (the Holy Spirit through the relics
of the prophet Elisha performed the miracle of the resurrection of the
dead).</p>
<p>In fact, the story shows that Peter became like the Lord Jesus
Himself in these miracles, as He had said earlier about those who truly
believed in Him.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Peter believes that the miracles
will be performed, that is, he <q>knows</q> about them in the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>For more on the faith of God, see the article here:

<p><reading>(John V, 1- 15) </reading>
</p>
<p>John V, 4  &ndash; ‘εμβας’  &ndash; ‘embas’  &ndash; <q>entered into</q> (the
water).</p>
<p>John V, 7  &ndash; ‘προ εμου’  &ndash; ‘pro emou’  &ndash; ‘before me’.</p>
<p>John V, 11, 15  &ndash; ‘υγιη’  &ndash; ‘hÛgie’  &ndash; (made) ‘healed, healthy, whole,
sound’.</p>
<p>The story of Jesus Christ’s healing of a man who was had an infirmity
on the Sabbath (hence the name of today’s Sunday  &ndash; the Sunday of the man
who had an infirmity).</p>
<p>The man had been like this for 38 years (of all the miracles
described in the Gospels, this is the longest documented duration),
which at that time (according to the usual measures of that time) was
most of a person’s life.</p>
<p>The Lord, having healed the man, tells him not to sin again, lest
something worse happen to him.</p>
<p>This is definitely not about a possible other illness that would have
lasted longer than the one from which the man was healed, because then
his total life duration would have been much longer than the average at
the time (remember that he was at the pool as an adult, sick for 38
years, so he was definitely in his 50s).</p>
<p>Moreover, the Lord does not speak of forgiving the man’s sins before
healing him, but warns him not to sin.</p>
<p>Therefore, in view of all this, as well as Jesus’ other healings, we
can think that the man was not a clear sinner, but he was not a clear
righteous man either. We can see the humility with which he waited
patiently for his turn for years, apparently not quarreling with the
healed who had gone before him, which shows his prudence and patience,
and his possible kindness. We can see his faith in God’s action in this
place (but not his faith in Jesus Himself before the healing).</p>
<p>The Lord, seeing his patience and humility, grants him healing
<q>simply for free</q>. At the same time, His purpose is to bring the man to
faith after the healing, which is why He manifests Himself to the healed
man after he has witnessed the fact before the Jews.</p>
<p>In view of all this, we can think that Jesus’ words <q>sin no more</q> are
another means of salvation for this man  &ndash; to strengthen his sound faith
and testimony about Jesus, to establish him in a state of long suffered
purity.</p>
<p>They also serve as a lesson to all those who receive unexpected and
desired blessings from God  &ndash; the better thanksgiving to God will be
purity from sin and a righteous godly life.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that the reading shows that there is
meaning in the so-called <q>holy places</q> and pilgrimages to them, to
shrines, but most of all in faith in Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
