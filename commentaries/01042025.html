<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Isaiah XL, 26 — ‘εἰς ὕψος’ - ‘eis hypsos’ - ‘up into the heights; high’. That is, where to. ἀπὸ πολλῆς δόξης’ - ‘apo polles doxes’ - ‘out of all glory’. It is about God's address to the creatures, here rather to the angels. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that this address gives glory to the angels, but does not make them gods in essence, it is a gift of God's grace. ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος’ - ‘en kratei iskhyos’ - ‘in keeping of strength; in keeping of power; in holding of strength’. The point is that the Lord is the Almighty, and everyone and everything is subject to His authority and nobody and nothing can escape it. The Lord does not lose His sovereign power, authority, might, nor does He transfer it to anyone, nor will He abandon it. In the 6th hour:
(Isaiah XL, 18-31) 
Isaiah XL, 21 — ‘ἐξ ἀρχῆς’ - ‘ex arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. This means that the message was given before it was necessary to use it. The Lord revealed the truth to people before people became responsible for being in the truth. It is this openness that is a necessary feature of friendship. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that it is not the beginning of a countdown, but that it was a foundational event - God's revelation to people, God's Covenant with people. Proverbs XV, 11 — ‘φανερὰ παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ’ - ‘phanera para to kyrio’ - ‘manifest in the vicinity of the Lord’. That is, even that which is remote from God is fully known and manifest to Him. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the dative case and indicates that it means that God does not even need to reflect to know the true state of affairs, He knows everything quite freely, effortlessly.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.

<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah XL, 18-31) </reading><br>
Isaiah XL, 21 — ‘ἐξ ἀρχῆς’ - ‘ex arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. This means that the message was given before it was necessary to use it. The Lord revealed the truth to people before people became responsible for being in the truth. It is this openness that is a necessary feature of friendship. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that it is not the beginning of a countdown, but that it was a foundational event - God's revelation to people, God's Covenant with people.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XL, 22 — ‘οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘hoi enoikountes en aute’ - ‘those who dwell in (on) it’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XL, 23 — ‘εἰς οὐδὲν’ - ‘eis ouden’ - ‘into no one; into nothing'. This means that the Lord fulfils His will even when the rulers of this world are against it.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XL, 24 — ‘εἰς τὴν γῆν’ - ‘eis ten gen’ - ‘into the ground’. In other words, there were no roots that had grown deep into the ground.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XL, 26 — ‘εἰς ὕψος’ - ‘eis hypsos’ - ‘up into the heights; high’. That is, where to. ‘ἀπὸ πολλῆς δόξης’ - ‘apo polles doxes’ - ‘out of all glory’. It is about God's address to the creatures, here rather to the angels.  The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that this address gives glory to the angels, but does not make them gods in essence, it is a gift of God's grace. ‘ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος’ - ‘en kratei iskhyos’ - ‘in keeping of strength; in keeping of power; in holding of strength’. The point is that the Lord is the Almighty, and everyone and everything is subject to His authority and nobody and nothing can escape it. The Lord does not lose His sovereign power, authority, might, nor does He transfer it to anyone, nor will He abandon it. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XL, 27 — ‘ἀπεκρύβη ἡ ὁδός μου ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘apekrybe he hodos mou apo tou theou’ - ‘my way has been concealed from God’. In other words, it is as if Israel (the faithful) began to live in such a way that ‘they became small, insignificant and unimportant before God’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is a complete diminution, as if Israel (the faithful) had become completely unimportant to God. The Lord refutes this further through Isaiah.

At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis XV, 1-15) </reading><br>
Genesis XV, 1 — ‘ἐν ὁράματι’ - ‘en horamati’ - ‘in a vision’. 
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 4 — ‘ὃς ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ σοῦ’ - ‘hos exeleusetai ek sou’ - ‘the one who will come out of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that the reference here is to a descent, i.e. a direct descendant, heir, son.
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 5 — ‘εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν’ - ‘eis ton ouranon’ - ‘into the sky’. That is, where.
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 6 — ‘ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην’ - ‘elogisthe auto eis dikaiosynen’ - ‘it was counted into righteousness’. That is, Abram's faith is righteous, and moreover, it made Abram righteous.
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 7 — ‘ἐκ χώρας Χαλδαίων’ - ‘ek khoras Khaldaion’ - ‘from the region of the Chaldeans’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that it is a question of coming out of where. A parallel to the Israelites' exodus from Egypt in the time of Moses.
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 13 — ‘ἐν γῇ οὐκ ἰδίᾳ’ - ‘en ge ouk idia’ - ‘in a land not their own; in a foreign land’. 
</p>
<p>
Genesis XV, 15 — ‘ἐν γήρει καλῷ’ - ‘en gerei kalo’ - ‘in a beautiful old age’. That is, in a deep, well-lived, happy old age.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs XV, 7-19) </reading><br>
Proverbs XV, 8 — ‘εὐχαὶ δὲ κατευθυνόντων δεκταὶ παρ’ αὐτῷ' - <q>eukhai de kateuthynonton dektai par auto</q> - <q>the prayers of the direct are acceptable in the vicinity of Him</q>. The preposition ‘para’ is with the dative case here and indicates that it refers to God's closeness, presence. In other words, people who pray to God should not be cunning, deceitful, tricky, etc.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XV, 10 — ‘ὑπὸ τῶν παριόντων’ - ‘hypo ton parionton’ - ‘by those who pass by; by passers-by’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case and indicates that it is the passive voice of the verb ‘is recognised’. The point is that the upbringing of people who are not deceitful (who do not conceal, pretend, or lie) is visible even to outsiders.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XV, 11 — ‘φανερὰ παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ’ - ‘phanera para to kyrio’ - ‘manifest in the vicinity of the Lord’. That is, even that which is remote from God is fully known and manifest to Him. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the dative case and indicates that it means that God does not even need to reflect to know the true state of affairs, He knows everything quite freely, effortlessly.
