it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Hebrews VI, 9-12) </reading><br>
Hebrews VI, 10 — ‘εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ’ - ‘eis to onoma autou’ - ‘into His name; for His name&#39;. That is, to the glory of God, out of gratitude to God, out of love for Him. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose. It is a common expression.

<reading>(Mark VII, 31-37) </reading><br>
Mark VII, 31 — ‘ἐκ τῶν ὁρίων Τύρου’ - ‘ek ton horion Tyrou’ - ‘from the territories of Tyre; from the regions of Tyre’. That is, from where. ‘εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τῆς Γαλιλαίας’ - ‘eis ten thalassan tes Galilaias’ - ‘into the Sea of Galilee’. Literally, ‘into the sea,’ but in terms of meaning, to coastal places. The often used pair of prepositions ‘ek’-‘eis’ indicates movement from one place to another.
</p>
<p>
Mark VII, 33 — ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου’ - ‘apo tou okhlou’ - ‘from the crowd’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Jesus called this man apart from the rest, showing him special attention that was different from the others in the crowd, which set him apart from the rest of the crowd. ‘εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ’ - ‘eis ta ota autou’ - ‘into his ears’. That is, where to. 
</p>
<p>
Mark VII, 34 — ‘εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν’ - ‘eis ton ouranon’ - ‘into the sky; up to the sky’. That is, where, in the direction of what or whom.
