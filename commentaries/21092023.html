<p>Ephesians I, 2, 3  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’
(our).</p>
<p>Ephesians I, 3-6, 8  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>Ephesians I, 5  &ndash; ‘προορισας’  &ndash; ‘proorisas’  &ndash; <q>foreordained; limited
in advance (in a broad meaning); pre-appointed; set in advance</q>. It
means that God intended people to live freely with Him in eternal love
and joy, to be good, holy, and so on. It does not mean that God has
determined who will be saved and who will not, but the very purpose of
creating the world and people in particular. See also:

<p>Ephesians I, 9  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘to us’.</p>
<p>The readings begin with the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the
Ephesians on weekdays.</p>
<p>Like most other Epistles, Paul begins with an appeal and praise of
God and spiritual blessings, as well as thanksgiving. This, as I noted
earlier, is what distinguishes the preaching of the apostles from that
of the prophets.</p>
<p>The introduction is solemn, uplifting, and magnificent, since the
entire message concerns the high mysteries of God, so the very beginning
sets one up for a high level of contemplation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this does not mean arrogance, but a humble thought of
the sublime.</p>
<p>The fact that people were created to be blessed in every blessing is
described here:

<p><reading>(Mark VII, 24-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>The casting out of a demon from the daughter of a
Gentile.</p>
<p>As this passage is understood, Christ’s dialogue was not intended to
offend or disrespect the woman or the Gentiles (i.e., all non-Jews at
the time) in general, for Christ knew that He would heal the daughter
and knew of the woman’s faith. But the Jews often sinned by treating
Gentiles with disdain. That is why Christ behaved like those Jews… in
order to put them to shame. For He is showing them what a woman’s faith
and humility really are, her trust in God in Christ, qualities that the
Jews often lacked.</p>
<p>The situation is thus very similar to the healing of the centurion’s
servant and the praise of his faith. See, in particular, in Matthew:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="02072023.html">02072023.html</a></p>
<p>If we go even deeper, there is a parallel with the prophet Elijah’s
stay in those lands when it had not rained for 3 and a half years
according to his word. At that time, the woman also obeyed Elijah, and
through him, the Lord, and was blessed because of it. Christ is Greater
than Elijah. This is also an example of the fact that although the
Revelation of God in the Old Testament was first of all addressed to the
Jews, the Lord also cared about other nations, and this is also clearly
shown in the time of Christ.</p>
<p>We can also see that Christ did not despise the Gentile woman from
the fact that… He praised her immediately after she spoke. If someone
despised someone in arrogance and saw the humility or at least modesty
of the person they despised, they would… become even more haughty
(emotions would take over). But Christ, instead of being scornful, shows
love and mercy. This also directly shows that He did not want to offend
the woman, but rather wanted to protect her and praise her (to set her
as an example).</p>

<p>It should be noted that Saint Dymytriy not only ordered the lives of
the saints, but was also a theologian, so the reading is
appropriate.</p>
