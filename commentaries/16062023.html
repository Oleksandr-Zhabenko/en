<p><reading>(Romans V, 17  &ndash; VI, 2) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s post:
<br><a class="link2" href="15062023.html">15062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>I wrote earlier, now I quote:</p>
<p><q>I will dwell more on the verse of Romans V, 20: â€™the law entered
that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded
much more</q>.</p>
<p>The translation misses many of the nuances that make the passage
difficult to understand (plus, the text is theological and difficult as
it is). A more nuanced translation reads: <q>The law (secretly) entered,
and as a result, transgression became more than enough. And where sin
became more than enough, where it was filled, grace overflowed.</q> The Law
of Moses did not increase the number of sins and did not encourage
anyone to sin, but before it, sin was less obvious and clear, and with
the coming of the Law it became clear and <q>â€˜filled upâ€™, it turned out
that there were more than enough sins to live badly. But the grace of
God appeared, giving more than there was before the fall. Before sin,
people were well in Paradise, and now, through grace, through the
Incarnation of the Son of God, we can have eternal life, which exceeds
the bliss of Paradise, we can live righteously in this age (see the next
verse), and finally we have unity with God through Jesus Christ. This is
what the apostle writes.</q></p>

<p><reading>(end of quote) </reading>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Verse 21 has a peculiar logic to Godâ€™s design for human salvation -
death (alas) entered and spread through sin, and righteousness enters
and spreads through grace.</p>
<p>The end of the reading is the beginning of the next one, so more on
that in due course.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IX, 14-17) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew IX, 17  &ndash; used literally â€˜ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„Î·Ï€Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„Î±Î¹â€™ -
â€˜syntereuntaiâ€™  &ndash; â€˜keep close togetherâ€™. That is, Godâ€™s intention is that
the new wine (New Testament doctrine and faith) should <q>keep close
together</q> with the disciples of Jesus. Then they will be mutually
preserved.</p>
<p>I also wrote earlier, and I quote:</p>
<p><q>The passage about the apostlesâ€™ fasting (or rather the absence of it
during Jesusâ€™ earthly life). Verses Matthew IX, 16-17 say that the main
thing for the godliness of the apostles was not fasting, but life with
Christ, while for the disciples of John the Baptist and the Pharisees,
who were waiting for the Messiah, fasting was very important. The
significance of fasting increases in the time of waiting.</q></p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
