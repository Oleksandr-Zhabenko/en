<reading>(1 Timothy III:1-13) </reading><br>
1 Timothy III, 6, 7 &mdash; '·ºêŒºœÄŒ≠œÉ·øÉ' - 'empese' - (not) 'fallen' (to fall). 
</p>
<p>
A description of the requirements for the clergy. In those days, they could all be married, and mostly were, although it was never mandatory.
</p>
<p>
Women are mentioned as deaconesses, who also existed in those days. Now this institution has been preserved in the Patriarchate of Alexandria, and there are also opinions that it should be revived in general.
</p>
<p>
The list of requirements is quite clear, mostly it refers to tested and experienced candidates who also have a good reputation among the Gentiles, since most of the people around them were Gentiles (Timothy, like Paul, mostly worked among the Gentiles).
</p>
<p>
Many of these requirements have become part of canon law with some modifications (in particular, bishops are now, for many centuries, exclusively unmarried).

<reading>(Luke XX, 9-18) </reading><br>
Luke XX, 14 &mdash; '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).
</p>
<p>
Luke XX, 17 &mdash; '·ºêŒºŒ≤ŒªŒ≠œàŒ±œÇ' - 'emplepsas' - 'looked' (looked).

<p>
It is worth noting that the objections of the people show that they were aware that the parable was about their environment, which often did reject God, and in particular about the high priests and scribes, who also understood that the parable was about them. Nevertheless, they did not have faith and repentance, but instead had anger and a desire to kill Jesus.
