<p><reading>(2 Corinthians XIII, 3-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>The actual conclusion of 2
Corinthians.</p>
<p>It is also a direct continuation of yesterday’s reading, which was
spoken about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="05092023.html">05092023.html</a><br></p>
<p>2 Corinthians XIII, 3  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (in) ‘me’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XIII, 4, 6, 7, 9  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XIII, 9  &ndash; ‘καταρτισιν’  &ndash; ‘katartisin’  &ndash; ‘training,
perfecting’.</p>
<p>Verse 4 would be quite understandable if it were <q>by the power of God
which is in US</q>. But it says <q>in YOU</q>. Here Paul implies that the
concern for the salvation and knowledge of the truth of the believers is
even more important to the apostles than the concern for their own
salvation and knowledge of the truth (although both are very important).
Thus, the apostles’ love for their neighbours exceeds their love for
themselves, and we are all called to this.</p>
<p>All the following verses to the closing greetings must be understood
with this in mind.</p>
<p>Verse 8 means <q>for the truth, for the sake of the truth</q>. The power
of the apostles is in the truth itself, so this power is for the truth
and for the sake of the truth, but not against it.</p>
<p>In verse 9, Paul says that he writes about the judgement in order to
do the work of the judgement in time. There is also evidence here that
the apostle’s judgement is aimed at building up and resolving, not at
destroying.</p>
<p>The <q>holy kiss</q> is a friendly kiss. See more about kissing here:

<p>The completion  &ndash; the wish for unity with the whole Trinity  &ndash; is
included in the text of the Divine Liturgy.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark IV, 35-41) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark IV, 35  &ndash; ‘ημερα’  &ndash; ‘emera’  &ndash; ‘of the day’.</p>
<p>For the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew VIII, 18, 23-27), see
the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="15062023.html">15062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Mark has more details. In particular, there are Jesus’ words about
faith. See a good essay on faith here:
