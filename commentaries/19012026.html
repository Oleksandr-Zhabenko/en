https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10062025.html
Romans I, 17 — &amp;#39;ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν, καθὼς γέγραπται, ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται&amp;#39; — &amp;#39;ek pisteos eis pistin, kathos gegraptai, ho de dikaios ek pisteos zesetai&amp;#39; - from faith to faith, similarly as it is written: &amp;#39;But the righteous from faith shall live&amp;#39;. According to that written above, in particular by the links, Paul writes about the origin of the life of the righteous — it is a continuation and manifestation of their faith. He does not say that faith here is the source of life in itself as such (which one can think from some unclear translations), but has in mind that the life of the righteous is an organic continuation and logical consequence of their faith, at the same time is a movement to the future accomplishment of faith as the expected Kingdom of God. Faith in these words is the point of departure of life, and in the previous ones — also the point of destination of the movement, but already accomplished, that is, to a certain degree attained and accomplished. The person who has fulfilled God&amp;#39;s will, the commandments, is righteous, at the same time their state entirely can be called new faith, into which they have arrived through fulfilment and life. Also here are seen two meanings — the righteous shall live from faith, but also the righteous from faith will live. That is, it is spoken both about righteousness, and at once also about righteousness from faith, from faith, which is an organic continuation, accomplishment and development of faith."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(James II, 14-26) </reading><br>
James II, 16 — &#39;τις αὐτοῖς ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;tis autois ex hymon&#39; - <q>someone of you</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here that it is spoken about a representative of the group of the faithful. &#39;ἐν εἰρήνῃ&#39; - &#39;en eirene&#39; - <q>in peace</q>. That is, this is a wish of well-being, health, happiness.
</p>
<p>
James II, 18 — &#39;κἀγώ σοι δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν&#39; - &#39;kago soi deixo ek ton ergon mou ten pistin&#39; - <q>and I to you will show from my works the (true) faith</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates that here it is spoken about the true vision of faith, and not imaginary. The possibility to manifest faith is good. But without works of faith to do this is almost impossible. Faith is not in the uniqueness of knowledge or conviction, but in union with God.
</p>
<p>
James II, 20 — <q>without works is vain, idle, inactive</q> — in no way manifests itself outwardly. The same word when it is spoken about <q>an idle word</q>, for which people will give answer.
</p>
<p>
James II, 21 — &#39;οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη&#39; - &#39;ouk ex ergon edikaiothe&#39; - <q>not from works was he justified; was he not from works justified</q>. By the meaning of the passage rather the second variant of translation. Analogously to verse 17.
</p>
<p>
James II, 22 — <q>faith co-worked with actions (συνηργει τοις εργοις)</q> — <q>and from actions (as from a source) faith reached perfection, completeness</q> — truly, if faith had not been accomplished in the deed, then Abraham would not have received the prototype, would not have become an example. &#39;ἐκ τῶν ἔργων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη&#39; — &#39;ek ton ergon he pistis eteleiothe&#39; - <q>from works faith reached completeness</q>. Here the preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that which brought faith to the state of perfection — life according to it. For this is necessary in order that faith be perfect.
</p>
<p>
James II, 23 — &#39;ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην&#39; - &#39;elogisthe auto eis dikaiosynen&#39; - <q>was reckoned to him for righteousness</q>. That is, by what such faith manifested itself.
</p>
<p>
James II, 24 — &#39;ἐξ ἔργων&#39; - &#39;ex ergon&#39; - <q>from works</q>. &#39;ἐκ πίστεως μόνον&#39; - &#39;ek pisteos monon&#39; - <q>from faith only; from faith alone</q>. Here in both cases the preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its forms indicates that which truly served for justification.
</p>
<p>
James II, 25 — &#39;οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη&#39; - &#39;ouk ek ergon edikaiothe&#39; - <q>not from works was she justified; was she not from works justified</q>. Analogously to verse 21 rather the second variant.
</p>

This place is often understood in a certain sense as a certain complement to the words of the Apostle Paul, and sometimes they even try to oppose, seeking opposition. But the meaning of the use of the preposition &#39;ek&#39; in all these texts refutes such a vision. The Apostles Paul and James in truth express one and the same thought. I quote:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10062025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/10062025.html</a><br>
Romans I, 17 — &#39;ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν, καθὼς γέγραπται, ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται&#39; — &#39;ek pisteos eis pistin, kathos gegraptai, ho de dikaios ek pisteos zesetai&#39; - <q>from faith to faith, similarly as it is written: &#39;But the righteous from faith shall live&#39;</q>. According to that written above, in particular by the links, Paul writes about the <q>origin</q> of the life of the righteous — it is a continuation and manifestation of their faith. He does not say that faith here is the source of life in itself as such (which one can think from some unclear translations), but has in mind that the life of the righteous is an organic continuation and logical consequence of their faith, at the same time is a movement to the future accomplishment of faith as the expected Kingdom of God. Faith in these words is the point of departure of life, and in the previous ones — also the point of destination of the movement, but already accomplished, that is, to a certain degree attained and accomplished. The person who has fulfilled God&#39;s will, the commandments, is righteous, at the same time their state entirely can be called <q>new faith</q>, into which they <q>have arrived</q> through fulfilment and life. Also here are seen two meanings — the righteous <q>shall live from faith</q>, but also <q>the righteous from faith</q> will live. That is, it is spoken both about righteousness, and at once also about righteousness from faith, from faith, which is an organic continuation, accomplishment and development of faith.
