<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: John X, 32 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ πατρός’ - ‘ek tou patros’ - ‘from the Father’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates that these works of Christ come from the Father in the sense that they reveal the Father, they are done in accordance with the Council of the Trinity. Christ does these works, but they reveal the Father. Acts XV, 39 — ‘ἐγένετο δὲ παροξυσμὸς ὥστε ἀποχωρισθῆναι αὐτοὺς ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων&amp;amp;#39; - egeneto de paroxysmos hoste apokhorithenai autous ap allelon - there was a disagreement, so they separated from each other. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that they were completely separated from each other, so that they were no longer together in travelling and apostolic work. The presence of community and ministry, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, does not mean that there is complete agreement on everything among people. At the same time, we need to remember Christ&amp;amp;#39;s words about what would happen if two or three of the disciples agree to pray about a certain thing. See more here:

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts XV, 35-41) </reading><br>
Acts XV, 35 — ‘ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ’ - ‘en Antiokheia’ - ‘in Antioch’. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 36 — ‘ἐν αἷς’ - ‘en hais’ - ‘’in whom; where‘’. A common expression. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 38 — ‘τὸν ἀποστάντα ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Παμφυλίας&#39; - <q>ton apostanta ap auton apo Pamphylias</q> - <q>the one who separated from them from Pamphylia</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ is used twice, indicating that John (Mark) had completely left them, as well as Pamphylia. ‘μὴ συνελθόντα αὐτοῖς εἰς τὸ ἔργον’ - ‘me synelthonta autois eis to ergon’ - ‘who did not accompany them to the work (for the work)’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the activity.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 39 — ‘ἐγένετο δὲ παροξυσμὸς ὥστε ἀποχωρισθῆναι αὐτοὺς ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων&#39; - <q>egeneto de paroxysmos hoste apokhorithenai autous ap allelon</q> - <q>there was a disagreement, so they separated from each other</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that they were completely separated from each other, so that they were no longer together in travelling and apostolic work. The presence of community and ministry, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, does not mean that there is complete agreement on everything among people. At the same time, we need to remember Christ&#39;s words about what would happen if two or three of the disciples agree to pray about a certain thing. See more here:<br>

‘εἰς Κύπρον’ — ‘eis Kypron’ - ‘to Cyprus’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 40 — ‘παραδοθεὶς τῇ χάριτι τοῦ κυρίου ὑπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν’ - ‘paradotheis te khariti tou kyriou hypo ton adelphon’ - ‘having been handed over (entrusted) to the grace of the Lord by the brothers’. The preposition ‘hypo’ is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle in the phrase ‘having been handed over’.

John X, 28 — ‘εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα’ — ‘eis ton aiona’ — <q>for ever.</q> A common expression. ‘ἐκ τῆς χειρός μου’ — ‘ek tes kheiros mou’ — <q>out of My hand.</q> From where. There is no one stronger than Christ.
