it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<reading>(2 Corinthians III, 12-18 ) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians III, 13 — &#39;εἰς τὸ τέλος&#39; - &#39;eis to telos&#39; - <q>unto the end; unto completion</q>. One can think that they were <q>gazing</q>, that is, Moses wanted his face&#39;s aging not to distract from knowing God. At the same time God wanted the glory of Moses&#39;s face also to prompt people to knowledge of God. Although formally Moses tried to do the <q>opposite</q> to God (hid his face, which God on the contrary wanted to glorify), they acted jointly together towards one common goal — to promote knowledge and glorification of God.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians III, 14 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. Emphasises life in Christ. That is, it is not enough simply to be Christians by convictions, but one also needs to live in Christ to remove that <q>veil</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians III, 18 — &#39;ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν&#39; - &#39;apo doxes eis doxan&#39; - <q>from glory to glory</q>. Here is used the preposition &#39;apo&#39; instead of the more often used in such cases preposition &#39;ek&#39;. This first emphasises that people <q>go out and leave</q> the old for the new. Similar logic in the Gospels is in the parables about new wineskins and new garment. See more at the links:<br>

&#39;ἀπὸ κυρίου πνεύματος&#39; — &#39;apo kyriou pneumatos&#39; - <q>from the Lord&#39;s Spirit</q>. Here the preposition &#39;apo&#39; is used in another sense — emphasising that this is a gift of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Paul very figuratively and deeply describes the experience of the New Covenant in comparison with the Old Testament Moses and Israelites. Moses hid the glory, because his body was old (he was 80-120 years old, although he retained firmness of body and complete full clarity of mind), and also so that the Israelites would not see divinity in him. Paul wrote earlier that the Old Covenant has glory, but it passes away, on the other hand the New is such that it will continue. And here he explains how this glory of the New Covenant, God&#39;s redemption and salvation, glorification and similar things through cooperation with God of the faithful in Christ, in the Holy Spirit, how this glory transfigures them — <q>from glory to glory</q> — that is, does not fade, does not stop, but continues and grows.
</p>
<p>
By <q>veil</q> is figuratively called the need to wait for Christ. While a person waits for Christ as not one who is already Christ&#39;s, waits as if alien, until then also this <q>veil</q> is on them. And when they become Christ&#39;s, become <q>one&#39;s own</q> to Christ, the <q>veil</q> is removed, giving way to the <q>unveiled face</q> of union with Christ and co-transfiguration with Him in the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
In fact all together means that the Lord Jesus Christ, in Whose image all people are created, seeks to transfigure people in salvation so as to remove this veil, this <q>obstacle</q> of <q>only expectation</q>, and not reality itself, so that we would know Him <q>face to face</q>, openly, freely and boldly.

<reading>(Luke VI, 1-10) </reading><br>
Luke VI, 1 — &#39;ἐν σαββάτῳ&#39; - &#39;en sabbato&#39; - <q>on a Sabbath</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 4 — &#39;εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis ton oikon tou theou&#39; - <q>into the house of God</q>. That is, into the temple. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 6 — &#39;ἐν ἑτέρῳ σαββάτῳ&#39; - &#39;en hetero sabbato&#39; - <q>on another Sabbath</q>. When. &#39;εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν&#39; - &#39;eis ten synagogen&#39; - <q>into the synagogue</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ&#39; - &#39;en to sabbato&#39; - <q>on the Sabbath</q>. Here with the article, which can indicate that this is not simply a day of the week, not only God&#39;s commandment, but a special commandment and practice, important for the scribes and Pharisees themselves, something defining for them and their piety.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 8 — &#39;εἰς τὸ μέσον&#39; - &#39;eis to meson&#39; - <q>into the midst; in the middle</q>. Common expression. Where to.
</p>
<p>
I wrote regarding the parallel passage in Matthew:<br>
The key to understanding in this passage — Matthew XII, 7 — a quotation from the prophet Hosea VI, 6: <q>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and knowledge of God more than burnt offerings</q>. These very words show what the Lord wants us to do on the Sabbath (Sunday, the Lord&#39;s Day, on feasts, if more generally).
</p>
<p>
Mercy and knowledge of God.
</p>
<p>
The priests are innocent, for they perform service, and this is both; David was not guilty, for by this was revealed God&#39;s good will towards him; the apostles are not guilty, for they testify by this that they are with the Lord Jesus Christ. One can continue this list further, particularly regarding the Jews themselves and their gatherings in synagogues on Sabbaths.
</p>
<p>
Also these words have a more general sense — for good the time is always right. That is, for true good time is not an obstacle.
