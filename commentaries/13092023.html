<author>Oleksandr Zhabenko</author></p><p> 🇬🇧 Glory be to Jesus Christ! 🌞 <dedication>Dedicated to Emma Kok.</dedication></p>
<p>To the renewal (consecration) of the Temple of the Resurrection of
the Lord in Jerusalem: <br>
<reading>(Hebrews III, 1-4; Matthew XVI, 13-18)</reading> <br>
Hebrews III, 1  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our). From the Apostle’s reading, we
see that Christ is as much Higher than Moses as God is Higher than
creation. Hence, since God is incomparably higher than creation, and
there are no <q>intermediate links</q> between God and creation, between the
uncreated and the created, between the eternal and the temporal, it is
clearly seen that Christ is God, Creator, Builder (Architect and
Builder), Apostle (Ambassador) and High Priest.</p>
<p>For the Gospel readings, please see the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="12072023.html">12072023.html</a><br> Parallel
to the place of the Passion, Death on the Cross, Burial and Resurrection
of Jesus Christ, through which the Lord Jesus Christ defeated sin and
death.</p>
<p>Since tomorrow is a great feast, the readings from tomorrow are
carried over to today, so there are two readings:<br>
<reading> (Galatians III, 15-22, 23  &ndash; IV, 5)</reading> <br>
Galatians III, 24  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (ours).</p>
<p>Galatians IV, 3  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘ημεν’  &ndash; ‘emen’  &ndash; ‘were’.
‘ημεθα’  &ndash; ‘emetha’  &ndash; ‘were’.</p>
<p>These readings are preceded by the one described at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="15042023.html">15042023.html</a></p>
<p>I wrote about the verses of Galatians III, 23-29 (the beginning of
the second part of the readings) earlier, see here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="02042023.html">02042023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul testifies that God gave Abraham the blessing through the promise
fulfilled in Jesus Christ, not through the Law.</p>
<p>Galatians III, 29  &ndash; through Christ the faithful became children of
Abraham, and in fact inherited the promises of God that were given to
Abraham himself. In other words, Christ is figuratively the Key to all
possible doors of God’s promises, He opens and leads to the fulfilment
of all God’s promises (cf. John X).</p>
<p>These words were important for the Galatians, whose conscience was
influenced by Christians who wanted the Galatians to fulfil the entire
ceremonial Mosaic Law, in effect becoming Jews first and then
Christians. Those people talked more about… Abraham than about Christ.
It is against this misunderstanding of the meaning of God’s Providence
and promises among those people, and therefore of faith in general, that
Paul speaks out.</p>
<p>I wrote about the role and significance of the Law when considering
the Epistle to the Romans. See, in particular, the following links:

<br>
<a class="link2" href="20062023.html">20062023.html</a><br> and the
references cited therein.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to refer to the traditions of the time, when slavery was
common and children did not have many of the rights that they have today
with the spread of Christianity and the development of society.</p>
<p>There is a good article on Redemption in Christ at:

<a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>

<p><reading>(Mark VI, 7-13, 30-45) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark VI, 41  &ndash; ‘εμερισεν’  &ndash; ‘emerisen’ -
‘divided’  &ndash; from ‘μεριζω’  &ndash; ‘merizo’.</p>
<p>Mark VI, 45  &ndash; ‘εμβηναι’  &ndash; ‘embenai’  &ndash; ‘to get into’ (a boat).</p>
<p>The first reading is about the apostles’ sending out to preach during
Jesus’ earthly life. At that time the apostles had the Holy Spirit <q>near
to them</q> (close to them, i.e. God gave them what they needed, but they
were not His receptacle, they did not understand many things that they
would understand later, after Pentecost) (this is evident from Jesus’
words that the Holy Spirit was near to the apostles and they would have
Him).</p>
<p>For a parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew X, 1, 7-11, 14), see the
following links:
<br>

<br>
<a class="link2" href="20062023.html">20062023.html</a></p>
<p>The second reading is devoted to the rest of the apostles according
to Jesus (a unique place in Mark) and the miracle of the feeding of
5,000 men (not counting women and children, which is not explicitly
mentioned).</p>
<p>I wrote about the parallel passage about the miracle of feeding the
people in Matthew here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="30072023.html">30072023.html</a></p>
<p>Mark gives more details.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
