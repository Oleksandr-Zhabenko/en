<p><reading>(Romans XI, 25-36) </reading>
</p>
<p>Direct continuation of the previous reading:
<br><a class="link2" href="29062023.html">29062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Romans XI, 27  - endash â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  - endash â€˜emouâ€™  - endash â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>Romans XI, 36  - endash literally: <q>from Him (as Source, Beginning), through
Him (by Him) (as Power), and to (into) Him (as destination, as ultimate
Goal).</q> At all stages of development and improvement, God leads people
to good, to bliss, to Himself.</p>
<p>In general, this is a summary of several readings on the history of
Israel and Christians from the former Gentiles.</p>
<p>Paul <q>balances</q> the visions of both in relation to themselves and to
each other.</p>
<p>I would also add that <q>Godâ€™s gifts and calling</q> refers to
supernatural gifts and revelation, not natural gifts. People and nations
can receive natural gifts, they can lose them, these gifts can be
exhausted or replaced by new ones in a certain period of time, but Paul
says that supernatural gifts are irrevocable, that is, God does not give
them to take them away. Yes, people can reject these gifts, but the Lord
Himself will not take them away.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the people of the Old Testament did not
distinguish between Godâ€™s will and Godâ€™s permission, and Paul, quoting
them, does not distinguish either. Therefore, he describes what God has
permitted in terms of <q>locked up.</q></p>
<p>Then, finally, he shows what we should distinguish by speaking about
the depths of Godâ€™s mind and wisdom, but asking the question, he does
not go more than that. Rather, he wants to engage the listeners
themselves in active reflection so that they may come to discernment
gradually, through the work of the Holy Spirit, as they grow in
Christ.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XII, 1-8) </reading>
</p>
<p>The key to understanding in this passage is
Matthew XII, 7  - endash a quote from the prophet Hosea VI, 6: <q>For I desire
mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt
offerings.</q> These words show us what the Lord wants us to do on the
Sabbath (Sunday, the Lordâ€™s Day, on holidays, more generally).</p>
<p>Mercy and knowledge of God.</p>
<p>The priests are innocent because they are performing a service, which
is both; David was innocent because it revealed Godâ€™s favor to him; the
apostles were innocent because they testified that they were with the
Lord Jesus Christ. This list could go on and on, in particular with
regard to the Jews themselves and their gatherings in the synagogues on
the Sabbath.</p>
<p>These words also have a more general meaning: the time is always
right for good. In other words, time is not an obstacle to true
good.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
