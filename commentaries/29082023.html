<p><p><author>Oleksandr Zhabenko</author></p><p> 🇬🇧 Glory be to Jesus Christ! 🌞</p>
<p><dedication>Dedicated to Emma Kok.<dedication></p>
<p>To the Image of Jesus Christ: (Colossians I, 12-18; Luke IX, 51-56;
X, 22-24) Colossians I, 13  - endash ‘ημας’  - endash ‘emas’  - endash ‘us’.</p>
<p>Colossians I, 15  - endash ‘εικων’  - endash ‘eikon’  - endash ‘image, icon’ (hence the word
‘icon’, as well as the direct connection with the non-handmade image,
which is commemorated today).</p>
<p>The reading from the Apostle contains thanksgiving to God the Father
and a statement of faith concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Son is the image of the Father (the <q>invisible God</q>), born before
all creation (uncreated), is the Creator, for by Him (the <q>Word</q>) and
into Him (as the Goal, as the destination, i.e. all creation is directed
by God to the Son of God, everything is to be drawn to Him) all things
were created. This confession resonates with <q>I am the Alpha and the
Omega, the Beginning and the End (the Goal)</q> (Revelation I, 8,
17-18).</p>
<p>He is called the first-born from the dead because of the comparison
of the resurrection with birth  - endash the human condition changes both at the
resurrection and at birth (the meaning of the comparison).</p>

<p>Luke IX, 51  - endash ‘ημερας’  - endash ‘emeras’  - endash ‘days’.</p>
<p>Luke IX, 55-56  - endash many ancient manuscripts of the Gospel do not
contain the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>A lesson on the meekness of Jesus  - endash if one thinks about how to help
people achieve salvation, then one becomes meek and humane.</p>
<p>Daily readings are two connected into one sequence (for yesterday and
today): (2 Corinthians VIII, 7-15, 16  - endash IX, 5) 2 Corinthians VIII, 7, 9,
19, 20, 22-24, IX, 3  - endash ‘ημων’  - endash ‘emon’  - endash ‘us’ (our). The word ‘grace’ in
verse 7 can also be translated here as ‘good deeds’, ‘good actions’,
‘charity’, ‘beneficences’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VIII, 11-12  - endash ‘προθυμια’  - endash ‘prothymia’  - endash ‘readiness for
action, willingness, intention to act, zeal, motivation, eagerness,
purpose to act’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VIII, 19  - endash ‘προθυμιαν’  - endash ‘prothymian’  - endash ‘readiness for
action, willingness’ (see above, but here in the accusative case).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 8:20  - endash ‘ημας’  - endash ‘emas’  - endash ‘us’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VIII, 23  - endash ‘εμος’  - endash ‘emos’  - endash ‘my’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians IX, 4  - endash ‘εμοι’  - endash ‘emoi’  - endash ‘me’ ((with) me). ‘ημεις’ -
‘emeis’  - endash ‘we’.</p>
<p>Paul is telling the Corinthians to accomplish, to fulfil, what they
have been willing to do.</p>
<p>The humility of Christ motivates believers to perform acts of mercy,
especially towards the needy and poor.</p>
<p>Verse 12 means that if one does good for Christ’s sake, what they
have in giving to others will be pleasant and valuable, and what they do
not have will not be a hindrance. This is an example of the so-called
<q>positive thinking</q>  - endash in doing good for the sake of the Lord, one should
look at the willingness, motivation, and value of what is given. If
something is lacking in this case, you should not focus on this
lack.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to talk about social equality in a special sense -
<q>whoever has much (that much) should not be overwhelmed, and whoever has
little (that much) should not be lacking.</q> In fact, literally, these
words can be understood to mean that the <q>excess</q> of the rich should be
given to those who lack. At the same time, Paul does not oblige
Corinthians to do so, but encourages them to do so, so that those who
have sincere love for others do this way.</p>
<p>It must be said that in the time of the apostles there were no modern
social security and taxes for social needs, so such care was completely
arbitrary.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to speak about Titus and the other helpers, praising
them and the Corinthians for their care and work for the glory of
God.</p>
<p>He also prepares the Corinthians for later generosity.</p>

<p>(Mark III, 6-12, 13-19) After the Jesus’ healing of the sick man’s
hand, the Pharisees and the Zealots conspired to kill Him.</p>
<p>But Jesus, knowing all this as God, continues His work, heals many
people, casts out demons, and chooses 12 apostles.</p>
<p>As earlier, He forbids the demons to say that He is the Son of God,

<p>The names of the apostles in the different Gospels differ slightly
because some of them had two names.</p>
<p><q>Sons of thunder</q> is found only in Mark. It is believed that this
refers to their zeal, disposition, character, and a certain prophecy
about gifts.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
