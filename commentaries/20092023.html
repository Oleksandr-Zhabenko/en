<p>(Galatians VI, 2-10) A continuation of the frequent reading on the
fruits of the Holy Spirit, which is referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0ATzRM9rLerJpJXnRRQJ87gstYRsW4xXZnHDtEVCy3KtqCgmYtPmwC4f5KuBccRaal">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0ATzRM9rLerJpJXnRRQJ87gstYRsW4xXZnHDtEVCy3KtqCgmYtPmwC4f5KuBccRaal</a><br></p>
<p>Paul’s encouragement and exhortation is directly related to what he
has been talking about before, in particular the spiritual life. See
this link:
<br><a class="link2" href="19092023.html">19092023.html</a><br></p>
<p>In general, it can be said that here Paul is looking at the
individual in terms of his relationship with God and other people, not
in terms of society. Therefore, he is not talking about the importance
of spiritual life for society, but about the personal, about the
importance for each person in particular. Yes, the spiritual life is of
great importance for society, but it is also of even greater importance
for each person. This is true because everyone inherits eternity
personally.</p>
<p>In fact, what is meant here is what is called in modern language
<q>personal responsibility</q> of each human being before God. Yes, people
get saved together and can also perish together, but Paul does not say
this here, but rather that everyone is personally responsible to God for
themselves, for their deeds, actions (or inactions), thoughts and
words.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Paul encourages us to do good and to care for one
another.</p>
<p>(Mark VII, 14-24) Mark VII, 19 - ‘κοιλιαν’ - ‘koilian’ - <q>belly,
womb, stomach, heart; every organ within the belly</q>.</p>
<p>A direct continuation of the two previous Gospel readings, with the
second of which it has common verses. See the links for those two
readings:

<br><a class="link2" href="18092023.html">18092023.html</a><br></p>
<p>For the parallel passage in Matthew, see the following links:
<br><a class="link2" href="21072023.html">21072023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="19072023.html">19072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Food in itself cannot be evil unless it is connected to sin. And
sins, like virtues, are always connected to the human heart. Therefore,
it is the heart that is decisive in determining whether a person is
unclean or clean. Therefore, the faith of Christ is centred on the
purity of the heart, not on the purity of food.</p>
<p>The links at the top and others cited there elaborate on this
point.</p>
<p>I will add one more important reference on the heart here:

<p>To the Great Martyr Eustace Plakidas and those who are with him:
(Ephesians VI, 10-17; Luke XXI, 12-19) Ephesians VI, 12 - ‘ημιν’ -
‘emin’ - (to) ‘us’.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 13 - ‘ημερα’ - ‘emera’ - (on the) ‘day’.</p>
