it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians II, 3-15) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians II, 3 — 'ἀφ' ὧν' - 'aph hon' - <q>from those</q>. The preposition 'apo' in its form before the following 'ho' here indicates that the apostle would find reason for joy, rather than they themselves trying to cheer him.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 4 — 'ἐκ γὰρ πολλῆς θλίψεως καὶ συνοχῆς καρδίας' - 'ek gar polles thlipseos kai synokhes kardias' - <q>for from great sorrow and anguish of heart</q>. That is <q>by reason of</q>. 'εἰς ὑμᾶς' - 'eis hymas' - <q>in you; to you</q>. That is <q>concerning you</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 5 — 'ἀπὸ μέρους' - 'apo merous' - <q>in part; partially; partly</q>. As. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 6 — 'αὕτη ἡ ὑπὸ τῶν πλειόνων' - 'aute he hypo ton pleionon' - <q>that which is by many</q>. The preposition 'hypo' here with genitive case and indicates here that the punishment is carried out by others, that is actually the passive state <q>to be punished</q> by many.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 8 — 'κυρῶσαι εἰς αὐτὸν ἀγάπην' - 'kyrosai eis auton agapen' - <q>confirm love toward him!</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here the direction of love (toward whom?) as the direction of efforts and actions of the faithful.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 9 — 'εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ ἔγραψα' - 'eis touto gar kai egrapsa' - <q>for to this end I also wrote</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here the purpose of the action. 'εἰ εἰς πάντα ὑπήκοοί ἐστε' - 'ei eis panta hypekooi este' - <q>whether in all things (you) are obedient</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here the direction towards something of obedience to the faith.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 10 — 'ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ' - 'en prosopo CHristou' - <q>in the Person of Christ</q>. That is from Christ, on behalf of Christ, as Christ Himself would have done. Apostolic forgiveness is also accomplished by Christ, if it is pleasing to Him. Here is the connection with Christ's commandment in the Gospels, also Paul emphasises that he acted precisely according to Christ's will. Therefore indeed, that person whom Paul forgave here, was indeed forgiven by Christ as well.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 11 — 'ἵνα μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ σατανᾶ' - 'hina me pleonektethomen hypo tou satana' - <q>that we might not be overcome by Satan</q>. The preposition 'hypo' here with genitive case and indicates here the passive state of the construction that is here translated as <q>were overcome</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 12 — 'εἰς τὴν Τρῳάδα' - 'eis to Troada' - <q>to Troas</q>. Where to. 'εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ' - 'eis to euangelion tou CHristou' - <q>for the preaching Good News of Christ</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here the purpose of the action. 'ἀνεῳγμένης ἐν κυρίῳ' - 'aneogmenes en kyrio' - <q>opened in the Lord</q>. That is by Whom and how.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 13 — 'εἰς Μακεδονίαν' - 'eis Makedonian' - <q>to Macedonia</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 14 — 'ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ' - 'en to CHristo' - <q>in Christ</q>. In Whom. 'ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ' - 'en panti topo' - <q>in every place; everywhere</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians II, 15 — 'ἐν τοῖς σῳζομένοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις' - 'en tois sozomenois kai en tois apollymenois' - <q>among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing</q>. The mediopassive (middle / passive) voice of the participles here indicates that both groups of people largely participate both in salvation and in perishing, that is the latter are consequences precisely of the actions of those people.
</p>
<p>
A passage which is considered directly connected with the 1 Corinthians. There Paul taught to break communion with a brother in Christ who committed a public sin of debauchery. The Corinthians obeyed Paul, but that brother showed sincere and deep repentance, accepted the penance with sorrow, was converted, and suffered much because of the absence of communion with him by Christians. Therefore here Paul writes in order to show love to such a repentant sinner and forgive him. Paul made that decision then with pain, and now shows mercy and asks to forgive.
</p>
<p>
Here is an important point — according to God's design, Church disciplines and penance must not be hard-hearted under any circumstances. The faithful cannot under any circumstances be cruel. It can be very difficult to distinguish cruelty from justice, the fight against evil from the desire for revenge and other things, and Satan, knowing this, tries very hard to take advantage of these difficulties. Paul warns about this, and teaches to be merciful, not cruel.

It must be said that discipline among the first Christians was very high then, and with the passage of time it softened. The Church tries to be open to different people, since the Lord commands to try to find those who have perished.
</p>
<p>
<q>Open doors</q> — a figurative expression meaning absence of obvious obstacles, accessibility.
</p>
<p>
<q>Fragrance of knowledge</q> — a person is able to smell even initially without wanting to do so. Therefore from all the sense organs Paul chooses precisely smell when speaking about the fact that the preaching of faith by the apostles, like a smell, is impossible simply to ignore or not notice.
