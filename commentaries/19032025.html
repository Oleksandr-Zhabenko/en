it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah X, 12–20) </reading><br>
Isaiah X, 12 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιων καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘en to orei Sion kai en Ierousalem’ - ‘in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘en aute’ - ‘in it; with it’. The second option is preferable in terms of meaning. It refers to a chopper who chops with an axe, but from the perspective of the axe itself.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 16 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν σὴν τιμὴν’ - ‘eis ten sen timen’ - ‘into your honour’. ‘εἰς τὴν σὴν δόξαν’ - ‘eis ten sen doxan’ - ‘into your glory’. Here the Greek text addresses the Assyrians. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates where the Lord will send the shame and fire.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 17 &mdash; ‘εἰς πῦρ’ - ‘eis pyr’ - ‘the fire; as fire’. That is, it will become ‘what’ or ‘as what’. ‘ἐν πυρὶ καιομένῳ’ - ‘en pyri kaiomeno’ - ‘in the burning fire; with the burning fire’. Both translations are possible. Here we can find a prophecy about the Sacraments of the Church, about the baptism with the Spirit and fire, which John the Baptist speaks about. ‘The light of Israel, which will become fire’ can also refer to Christ and the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 18 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ ψυχῆς ἕως σαρκῶν’ - ‘apo psykhes heos sarkon’ - ‘(starting) from the soul and even to the fleshes’. Soul is in the singular, ‘flesh’ is in the plural. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the count. ‘ἀπὸ φλογὸς καιομένης’ - ‘apo phlogos kaiomenes’ - ‘from the burning flame’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that escape, avoidance of this will be like fleeing from a burning fire. The apostle Paul has a parallel to this image in his statement ‘he will be saved, but as if through the fire’. See more here:<br>

</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 19 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῶν' - <q>ap auton</q> - <q>from this</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that the escape will be complete, total.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah X, 20 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ’ - ‘en te hemera ekeine’ - ‘in that day; on that day’. 
</p>

At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis VII, 6–9) </reading><br>
Genesis VII, 7, 9 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν κιβωτὸν’ - ‘eis ten kiboton’ - ‘into the ark’. 
</p>
<p>
Genesis VII, 8 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν μὴ καθαρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς’ - ‘apo ton peteinon kai apo ton ktenon ton katharon kai apo ton ktenon ton me katharon kai apo panton ton herpeton ton epi tes ges’ - ‘from birds, and of clean beasts of burden, and of unclean beasts of burden, and of every creeping thing on the earth'. The preposition ‘apo’ is used throughout to indicate that a choice was made from a group of animals and that the chosen animals were separated from the rest because they had to survive.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs IX, 12–18 ) </reading><br>
Proverbs IX, 12 &mdash; ‘ἐν διψώδεσιν’ - ‘en dipsodesin’ - ‘in thirst; with thirst’. An unclear place, which most likely refers to an attempt to gather fruitless desert lands into one's ownership.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IX, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν πλατείαις’ - ‘en plateiais’ - ‘in the streets; along the streets; on the streets’. 
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IX, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν’ - ‘en tais hodois auton’ - ‘in their ways’. 
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IX, 18 &mdash; ‘παρ’ αὐτῇ' - <q>par aute</q> - <q>near her</q>. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the dative case and indicates proximity to the foolish woman. ‘ἐν τῷ τόπῳ’ - ‘en to topo’ - ‘in the place’. ‘ἀπὸ δὲ ὕδατος ἀλλοτρίου’ - ‘apo de hydatos allotriou’ - ‘from someone else's water’. ‘ἀπὸ πηγῆς ἀλλοτρίας’ - ‘apo peges allotrias’ - ‘from a someone else's spring’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the water and the spring may be perceived as a gift, something good and granted, but in reality it is a delusion.
