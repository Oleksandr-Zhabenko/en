<p>(Acts XII, 12-17) The story of Peter’s miraculous deliverance from
prison continues. See the beginning here:

<p>Acts XII, 15 - the faithful said that Rhoda had literally <q>really
gone mad</q> (‘μαινη’), but Rhoda confidently affirmed, insisted
(‘διισχυριζετο’).</p>
<p>It is important to note that although the Church had prayed earnestly
for Peter, they did not expect to see him there. The Lord granted the
faithful with Peter even more than they expected.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting the confidence of Rhoda, who did not follow
the opinions of those around her, holding on to the truth when it was
clear.</p>
<p>Acts XII, 16 - ‘επεμενεν’ - ‘epemenen’ - ‘continued, abided in’. The
word used to describe the amazement and delight of the faithful at
meeting Peter is literally ‘to come down from the position of
standing’.</p>
<p>(John VIII, 42-51) John VIII, 42 - ‘εμε’ - ‘eme’ - ‘Me’. ‘εμαυτου’ -
‘emautou’ - ‘Myself (Me) Myself’.</p>
<p>John VIII, 43, 51 - ‘εμην’ - ‘emen’ - ‘My’ (of language). ‘εμον’ -
‘emon’ - ‘My word’ (of the word).</p>
<p>John VIII, 45 - literally, <q>I tell the truth, and therefore you do
not believe Me.</q></p>
<p>John VIII, 46 - literally, <q>If I tell the truth, for what do you not
believe Me?</q></p>
<p>John VIII, 47 - literally, <q>He who (comes) from God, hears the
matters spoken (the subject of conversation, what is being discussed) of
God. For this reason you do not listen, because you are not of God.</q>
That is, it is not a matter of <q>hearing</q> literally, not of hearing some
kind of <q>gloss</q> or <q>voices</q> of God, but of perceiving and accepting
God’s plans and meanings, understanding Him, which can even happen
without words (as happens in close relationships between people).</p>
<p>Then the Jews are completely convinced that they are right and accuse
Jesus of being demon-possessed.</p>
<p>But the Lord continues to testify to the truth.</p>
<p>To the saints Boris and Gleb, princes, the sufferers: (Romans VIII,
28-39) Romans VIII, 28-29 - <q>foreknows… foreordained</q> - that is, God has
determined what like they should be and knows that they will actually
become like that (will be, or are, or have already become, depending on
the time in question). <q>Conformed (in form) to the image (icon) of the
Son of God</q> is literally translated. That is, they will have a
similarity and recognisability through Christ, in Him, from Him and up
to Him.</p>
<p>Romans VIII, 30 - ‘προωρισεν’ - ‘proorisen’ - ‘limited in advance (in
the broadest sense)’ - here, in particular, it is meant that God knows
all their characteristics (even the minor ones, because He knows
everything), He planned that they would and should be like this, etc.
This does not refer to the so-called Calvinist theory of <q>predestination
to salvation</q>. It is about:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the correspondence of God’s plan to Jesus Christ as the First
Image and</p></li>
<li><p>the correspondence of the vocation and the reality of the
existence of such people who are like the Son of God according to this
Divine intention.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone is called to this.</p>
<p>Romans VIII, 31, 32, 34 - ‘υπερ ημων’ - ‘hÛper hemon’ - ‘above us,
over us, superior to us’ God. Often understood as <q>for us</q> - but the
words also have a wider meaning in the Gospel, and here - see more about
that here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Hyper.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Hyper.html</a><br></p>
<p>Romans VIII, 37 - literally, <q>we are gaining a decisive victory, a
super victory, a hyper victory, a supreme victory</q>.</p>
<p>This reading is often read in memory of the martyrs and sufferers,
and in it Paul describes very clearly how the faithful overcome
everything through the love of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The words are very poetic, together also insightful, so I will limit
myself to these comments, which speak to some important points.</p>
<p>(John XV, 17 - XVI, 2) See the explanation earlier here:

<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
