it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Jude I, 1-10) </reading><br>
Jude I, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ’ - ‘en theo patri’ - ‘in God the Father’. 
</p>
<p>
Jude I, 4 &mdash; ‘εἰς τοῦτο τὸ κρίμα’ - ‘eis touto to krima’ - ‘for this judgement’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose. ‘εἰς ἀσέλγειαν’ - ‘eis asegeian’ - ‘into shamelessness; into depravity; into lasciviousness’. That is, they turn into what.
</p>
<p>
Jude I, 5 &mdash; ‘ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου’ - ‘ek ges Aigyptou’ - ‘from the land of Egypt’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates an exodus from Egypt.
</p>
<p>
Jude I, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς κρίσιν μεγάλης ἡμέρας’ - ‘eis krisin melages hemeras’ - ‘for the judgement of the great day’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose. ‘ὑπὸ ζόφον’ - ‘hypo zophon’ - ‘under the gloom’. The preposition ‘hypo’ is with the accusative case here and indicates being kept under the burden of the gloom.
</p>
<p>
Jude I, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν τούτοις’ - ‘en toutois’ - ‘in that actually; with that actually’. Both translations are possible. The first indicates that the biological in human beings can be a ‘medium’ for falling, and the second indicates that people themselves use the biological for sin, vices, and falls.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XXII, 39-42, 45-XXIII, 1) </reading><br>
Luke XXII, 39 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν’ - ‘eis to oros ton elaion’ - ‘to the Mount of Olives’. That is, ‘where to’.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 40, 46 &mdash; ‘εἰς πειρασμόν’ - ‘eis peirasmon’ - ‘into temptation; into trial’. Both translations are possible. A parallel to the Lord's Prayer.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 41 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῶν' - <q>ap auton</q> - <q>from them</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that Jesus has indeed distanced from the disciples.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 42 &mdash; ‘παρενέγκαι τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ' - <q>parenenkai touto to poterion ap emou</q> - <q>carry (away, past) this cup from Me; take this cup away from Me</q>.  The preposition ‘apo’ and the prefix ‘par’ indicate that it is both a movement near and aside, i.e. ‘coming close, passing by, passing without touching’. The use of complex shades of meaning with prepositions and prefixes indicates that the human will of Christ is looking for a special way to avoid experiencing what awaits. At the same time, Christ's human will is obedient to God's will. Christ does not seek to avoid what is coming, does not deny that it will happen, but entrusts Himself to the Father (and the Spirit). Only God can change it; the Lord trusts Him completely. See also more here:<br>

</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 45 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς προσευχῆς’ - ‘apo tes proseukhes’ - ‘from high, spiritual prayer’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that Jesus stopped praying in the way described here. ‘ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης’ - ‘apo tes lypes’ - ‘out of pain; out of sorrow’. The apostles fell asleep so as not to be sad. The illogic of human behaviour - sleep could not solve their grief for the better, because it is not fatigue, but they fell asleep anyway.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 49 &mdash; ‘ἐν μαχαίρῃ’ - ‘en makhaire’ - ‘with a sword’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 50 &mdash; ‘ἐξ αὐτῶν’ - ‘ex auton’ - ‘of them’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that it refers to someone from the group of disciples.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 53 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ’ - ‘en to hiero’ - ‘in the temple’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 54 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως’ - ‘eis ten oikian tou arkhiereos’ - ‘into the house of the high priest’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 55 &mdash; ‘ἐν μέσῳ’ - ‘en meso’ - ‘in the midst; in the middle’ (where).
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 58 &mdash; ‘ἐξ αὐτῶν’ - ‘ex auton’ - ‘of them’.  The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that it refers to someone from a group of people.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 65 &mdash; ‘εἰς αὐτόν’ - ‘eis auton’ - ‘in regard to Him; in relation to Him; towards Him’. That is, it indicates the direction of the mockery.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 66 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ συνέδριον’ - ‘eis to synedrion’ - ‘to the Sanhedrin’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 69 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν’ - ‘apo tou nyn’ - ‘from now on; henceforth’. It is a common expression. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of a time period and counting. ‘ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ex dexion tes dynameos tou theou’ - ‘from the right hand of the power of God’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates where Jesus will come from.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 71 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος’ - ‘apo tou stomatos’ - ‘out of the mouth’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the unrighteous judges considered this to be objective evidence of Jesus' <q>guilt</q> (although there is no guilt in being the Messiah, Christ, Saviour and King), so biased was their judgement.
