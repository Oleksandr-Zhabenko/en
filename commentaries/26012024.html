<reading>(Hebrews VII, 18-25) </reading><br>
The reading from the Apostle is preceded by the one referred to here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15022023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15022023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The immediate continuation of the reading from the Apostle is the one I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24052023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24052023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VII, 19 &mdash; '·ºêœÑŒµŒªŒµŒØœâœÉŒµŒΩ' - 'eteleiosen' - <q>completed, made complete, perfect, fully mature</q>. The Law was an improvement in that it made it possible to know what was sin and what was righteousness in a deeper and better way, but it could not make the doers perfect, nor could it save them. Instead, the Hope, Christ, Who is implicitly mentioned here and then explicitly spoken of later, is the saving and perfect one.
</p>
<p>
An oath from God means something final and unchangeable, so the High Priesthood of Jesus Christ is eternal and unchangeable.
</p>
<p>
There are no places in Scripture where God regrets His oath (promise), but such regret is common among humans because of their sinfulness and imperfection. Here, anthropomorphism is evident in the description of God.
</p>
<p>
It should also be noted that in the story of Noah, it is said that <q>God regretted</q> that he had created humans because of the growth of their iniquity, so he brought a flood on the earth. Here again we see typically Old Testament people's lack of distinction between God's permission and God's will &mdash; God is not really regretting the creation of humans (otherwise He would not have created anyone, knowing everything in advance), but He had pity, had mercy on future generations who could have been corrupted like Noah's contemporaries if they would have continued to exist as a civilisation and the flood would have not happened. I wrote more about this in my commentary on the story of the flood and the salvation of Noah and his family. See also:<br>

Paul also goes on to emphasise the eternity of Jesus Christ as the Living High Priest and Advocate forever. See also more on this here:<br>
