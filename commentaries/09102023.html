<p>(Philippians I, 1-7) Philippians I, 2 - ‘ημων’ - ‘emon’ - ‘us’
(our).</p>
<p>Philippians I, 5, 6 - ‘ημερας’ - ‘emeras’ - (of the) ‘day’.</p>
<p>Philippians I, 7 - ‘εμοι’ - ‘emoi’ - (to) ‘me’.</p>
<p>The reading from the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Philippians
begins. This church was the mainstay of Paul’s preaching in Europe, in
Greece, and Paul writes this letter not because of any difficulties they
are having, but because of their communion and sharing of joy and
encouragement.</p>
<p>The letter begins, as is typical of apostolic letters, with greetings
and praise. It also includes thanksgiving to God and the Philippians for
their support in all things and an expression of faith that they will
continue to walk well in the way of life in Christ.</p>
<p>(Luke VII, 36-50) I wrote a little earlier, but I also need to
clarify what I wrote there, so I quote: <q>Simon was a godly and
intelligent Pharisee who had kept the Law since childhood, but he did
not believe in Christ, perhaps even wanted to test Him.</q></p>
<p>I would like to point out that Jesus’ apparent reversal of
forgiveness and love may have another explanation. Jesus is talking to
Simon from the perspective of… Simon himself. Or rather, a reasonable
person who may be facing the same question as Simon. Jesus also gives an
answer to this question.</p>
<p>Simon (another reasonable person in his place) saw first Jesus’
forgiveness, and then, after Jesus’ words about love, he saw love
itself. In his eyes (in the eyes of another reasonable person), she was
<q>forgiven</q> - why - because she <q>loved</q>. That is, forgiveness precedes
love according to the logic of vision, according to the order of
awareness. But this does not mean that the woman was first forgiven by
Jesus and then loved Him.</p>
<p>But we can also think from another point of view that yes, indeed,
Jesus had forgiven the woman before she loved Him, because He had given
her grace as the God Who knows the hearts so that she could love Him.
The previous sentence could be explained more fully like this: Did God
love that woman? Yes, as His creation, as a being created to be the
daughter of God. Out of His love, He called her by grace to repentance,
to conversion, to love Jesus Christ. Did the woman obey? Yes, she did.
Did she love? Yes. So, her love was added to God’s love, or we can also
say that she entered into the love of God by her love, by her
repentance. Is this love great? Yes. Therefore, out of His love, God
forgave the woman’s sins through her participation in love.</p>
<p>Did Jesus forgive Simon’s sins? This is not explicitly stated. But it
is clear that Jesus visited him and taught him. And it is also clear
that forgiveness can be more important than teaching.</p>
<p>I’ll also talk about another thing.</p>
<p>Simon was tempted by the fact that a woman who had sinned in the past
touched Jesus as if she could seduce Him. But Jesus was not tempted by
this. Why: God looks at the heart of a person, and the woman had no
intention of seducing Jesus. So He does not look at her past, but at her
heart. If we hypothetically imagine that the woman did intend to seduce
Jesus in her heart, would Jesus have acted in the same way? From what we
know, He would not have allowed Himself to be tempted by a woman unless
there was God’s permission (for example, the temptation by the devil in
the desert was God’s permission until Jesus overcame all temptations,
and the Lord did not want to allow Peter to think in the way he tried to
convince Jesus to give up His intention to go to Jerusalem for
suffering).</p>

16-21) For more frequent readings from the Apostle, see this link:
