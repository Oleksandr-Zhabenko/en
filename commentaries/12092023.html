<p><reading>(Galatians II, 21  &ndash; III, 7) </reading>
</p>
<p>The key verse of the reading is Galatians
III, 2  &ndash; Paul says: <q>I only want to learn, to ascertainâ€¦</q> and then asks
how they received the gifts of the Holy Spirit. From this we can see how
much importance, one can say decisive, Paul attached to receiving the
gift of the Holy Spirit, grace, faith, and not to ritualistic
prescriptions and regulations. It also confirms that the present life is
not for keeping the Law, but for receiving the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 3 goes on to show that in the spiritual life a person is to
develop and move forward  &ndash; not backward  &ndash; from the less valuable to the
more valuable, from the body to the Holy Spirit, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>I wrote about verses 6-7 when I wrote about Abraham, also about sins
and death and salvation in Christ. See the links:

<p><reading>(Mark VI, 1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark VI, 3  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>For a parallel passage to the first 6 verses in Matthew (Matthew
XIII, 53-58), see:
<br><a class="link2" href="17072023.html">17072023.html</a></p>
<p>Mark specifies that <q>without honour only in his own country, among
his own relatives and in his own house</q> (in Matthew 2 out of 3). One
might think that Mark would again provide more details in this phrase.
Instead, the examples from the Old Testament are omitted because it is
believed that the addressees of Markâ€™s Gospel were Christians from Rome,
former Gentiles who had not grown up with examples from the Old
Testament (unlike the Jews to whom Matthewâ€™s Gospel was primarily
addressed).</p>
<p>Verse 7 speaks of the 12 apostles being sent out to preach during the
time of Jesusâ€™ earthly life. This sermon was to teach them how they
should act in the future (a sort of analogue of practice during
training).</p>
<p>To the Mother of God:<br>
<reading>(Philippians II, 5-11; Luke X, 38-42, XI,
27-28) </reading><br>

God, see the following link and others cited there:
