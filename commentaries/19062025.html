it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(John XXI, 15-25) </reading><br>
More on the reading from the Apostle, please refer to the links:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans V, 10-16) </reading><br>
Romans V, 10 — <q>σωθησόμεθα ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ</q> - <q>sothesometha en te zoe autou</q> - <q>we will be saved in His life; we will be saved by His life</q>. There are two possible translations here. The first indicates that the salvation of people is in the Resurrection of Christ from the dead, the second - that the life of the Risen Christ is the salvation of people.
</p>
<p>
Romans V, 11 — ‘καυχώμενοι ἐν τῷ θεῷ’ - ‘kaukhomenoi en to theo’ - ‘we boast in God; we boast with God’. The first translation is better in terms of meaning, since the second makes it seem as if God <q>becomes subordinate</q> to the desire of people to boast.
</p>
<p>
Romans V, 12 — <q>εἰς τὸν κόσμον</q> - <q>eis ton kosmon</q> - <q>into the world</q>. Where to. See the explanation at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15062023.html https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/04072024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15062023.html https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/04072024.html</a><br>
&#39;καὶ οὕτως εἰς πάντας ἀνθρώπους ὁ θάνατος διῆλθεν&#39; — &#39;kai houtos eis pantas anthropous ho thanatos dielthen&#39; - &#39;in the same way death has passed into all people&#39;. Sin became a <q>conductor</q> of death (as in current) or a <q>channel</q> (as in communication). The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates here where death has passed, i.e. people have become the <q>place</q> of death, i.e. they have begun to perish, to die. It indicates that death here cannot be understood in a purely biological way, but rather is primarily a spiritual death that called for physical death as a consequence.
</p>
<p>
Romans V, 13 — <q>ἐν κόσμῳ</q> - <q>en kosmo</q> - <q>in the world</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans V, 14 — <q>ἀπὸ Ἀδὰμ μέχρι Μωϋσέως</q> - <q>apo Adam mekhri Moyseos</q> - <q>from Adam to Moses</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates the beginning of the count in the range. As for the ending and meaning of the verse, I will quote:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/04072024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/04072024.html</a><br>
&#39;τύπος τοῦ μέλλοντος&#39; — &#39;typos tou mellontos&#39; - &#39;figure, model, example, type of what was about to come (according to the logic of events and circumstances)&#39;. A place that is difficult to understand. The word &#39;death&#39; (ὁ θάνατος) in Greek and the word Adam are both masculine and are in the nominative case here. The word <q>that</q> (which) preceding this phrase can refer either to Adam or to death. In the first case, Adam is a <q>type of the transgression,</q> meaning that all subsequent sins of humans are similar in general to the fall of Adam, and therefore death reigned over humans because all humans sinned. If the word <q>that</q> refers to death, then <q>death comes for everyone according to the logic of death after sin.</q> It must be said that almost all translations give the first option.

<p>
Romans V, 15 — ‘καὶ ἡ δωρεὰ ἐν χάριτι τῇ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ’ - ‘kai he dorea en khariti te tou henos anthropou Iesou CHristou’ - ‘and the gift in that grace which is through one Man Jesus Christ’. That is, the gifts of God (here in the singular, generally ‘the gift’), which were given to people because of what Christ as a human being gives in His grace, and also because He Himself is in the grace of God as the Human Being. For God&#39;s gifts, both the fact that Christ is full of grace as the Human Being and that He gives grace to people are important. &#39;εἰς τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐπερίσσευσεν&#39; - <q>eis tous pollous eperisseusen</q> - <q>has overflowed into many</q>. That is, they came so abundantly and generously that they were more than people could hold. It is an important truth of faith and revelation that God often gives more gifts to many than they can hold, that is, they overflow.
</p>
<p>
Romans V, 16 — <q>μὲν γὰρ κρίμα ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς κατάκριμα, τὸ δὲ χάρισμα ἐκ πολλῶν παραπτωμάτων εἰς δικαίωμα</q> - &#39;men gar krima ex henos eis katakrima, to de kharisma ek pollon paraptomaton eis dikaioma&#39; - <q>indeed, for judgement is from one (fall, sin) to condemnation, and grace is from many transgressions to justification</q>. The pairs of prepositions &#39;ek&#39;-&#39;eis&#39; indicate a movement from and to - the sin of one person led to the condemnation (and this is very simple in quantitative terms: one cause - one consequence), but grace is greater, because it saves from many sins and leads to righteousness, justification.

<reading>(Matthew VIII, 23-27) </reading><br>
Matthew VIII, 23 — <q>εἰς τὸ πλοῖον</q> - <q>eis to ploion</q> - <q>into the boat</q> (to the boat). Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew VIII, 24 — <q>ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ</q> - <q>en te thalasse</q> - <q>in the sea; on the sea</q>. Where. &#39;καλύπτεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων&#39; - <q>kalyptesthai hypo ton kymaton</q> - <q>was covered with waves</q>. That is, the boat was being filled with water from the waves that covered it from above. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle &#39;was covered&#39;.
