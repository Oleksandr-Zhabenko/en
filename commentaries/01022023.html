<p>There were two readings today, one of which was devoted to the Reverend.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XII, 28-37) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the regular Gospel, we read about the two greatest commandments of love for God and neighbour. I wrote in more detail about Luke's parallel place. See:</p>
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/posts/pfbid02HYwUyFHdCmCQWst6t3fMbdsGUBhHaFGpKksg2j4PvXxm3zoqdZZbsTnXPzzt6jk9l" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/postsa>
<p>Also, that Jesus is not just a fleshly descendant of King David, Abraham, ultimately a Jew, but is Lord (and God). In particular, people are mistaken who think that Christianity is a <q>Jewish religion</q>, i.e. purely national, and who on this basis looking for something else.</p>
<p>1 Peter IV, 1-11 was read from the daily Apostle. Again a rich passage, I will dwell only on the next points.</p>
<p>1) 1 Peter IV, 3-5  &ndash; <q>the will of the Gentiles</q>  &ndash; a different word is used than in relation to the will of God and the above. It is possible to think that it is not a direct and immediate manifestation of their will, but tendencies, inclinations that manifest themselves more or less. Not all pagans lived in sin, Peter is not a cunning accuser, but all pagans without Christ can succumb to all the mentioned temptations and tendencies. This susceptibility is called <q>will</q> here. These sins are like elements that could <q>catch</q> pagans (similarly now). In the worst case, they not only did not understand Christians, but also condemned and slandered them. <q>will give an answer</q> is not a threat, but a reminder that is waiting for everyone  &ndash; we need to give a good answer at the Court of God in order to enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>2) 1 Peter IV, 1-2  &ndash; <q>he who has suffered in the body has ceased (stopped) sinning</q>  &ndash; present suffering through experience can motivate people not to sin  &ndash; <q>arm yourself with the thought</q>  &ndash; this reasoning does not bring comfort when a person lives well (in peace) ), but when he / she is in a struggle, as if in a battle, then such an <q>additional thought</q> can help her as a spiritual weapon. It is good to live in peace, but if a person is already struggling, suffering, then it is advisable by Peter for him / her wisely have experience as a means against sin.</p>
<p>3) 1 Peter IV,11  &ndash; literally <q>as if by the power that God directs, like a conductor or choir leader.</q> Not just one force, but many, <q>many-empowered</q> under the control of God. Comparison, which reveals not only motivation, but also diligence.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
