it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Galatians II, 21-III, 7) </reading><br>
Galatians III, 2, 5 — 'ἀφ' ὑμῶν' - 'aph hymon' - <q>from you</q>. The preposition 'apo' in its form before 'hy' indicates here emphasis on the answer itself, and not on something else (only an answer to the question is needed). 'ἐξ ἔργων' - 'ex ergon' - <q>from works</q>. 'ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως' - 'ex akoes pisteos' - <q>from heard faith</q>. That is from heard testimony about faith, from preaching about faith. The preposition 'ek' in its form before the following vowel indicates here what served for receiving the Holy Spirit in reality.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 5 — 'ἐν ὑμῖν' - 'en hymin' - <q>in you</q>. In whom.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 6 — 'εἰς δικαιοσύνην' - 'eis dikaiosynen' - <q>unto righteousness</q>. That is to what it led him.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 7 — 'ἐκ πίστεως' - 'ek pisteos' - <q>from faith</q>. What has faith as source. See more by the links:<br>

<reading>(Mark VI, 1-7) </reading><br>
Mark VI, 1 — 'εἰς τὴν πατρίδα αὐτοῦ' - 'eis ten patrida autou' - <q>to His fatherland</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 2 — 'ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ' - 'en te synagoge' - <q>in the synagogue</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 3 — 'ἐν αὐτῷ' - 'en auto' - <q>with Him; about Him</q>. That is concerning Him. Christ Himself did not tempt them in any way, which is indicated by the middle or passive voice of the verb used here regarding temptation.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 4 — 'ἐν τῇ πατρίδι ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἐν τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ' - 'en te patridi heautou kai en tois syngeneusin autou kai en te oikia autou' - <q>in his fatherland, and among his relatives, and in his house</q>. Where. Mark specifies that without honour only in his native land, among his relatives and in his house (in the parallel place in Matthew XIII, 53-58 are named 2 of these 3).

Verse 7 speaks about the sending of the 12 apostles to preach during the earthly life of Jesus Christ. This preaching was to teach them how they should act in the future (a kind of analogue of practice during learning).
