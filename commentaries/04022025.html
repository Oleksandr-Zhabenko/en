it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Peter III, 10-22) </reading><br>
1 Peter III, 10, 11 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ κακοῦ’ - ‘apo kakou’ - ‘from evil’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that we need to guard ourselves completely, totally.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 12 &mdash; ‘ὦτα αὐτοῦ εἰς δέησιν αὐτῶν’ - ‘ota autou eis deesin auton’ - ‘His ears towards their (diligent) prayer’. Prayer is in the singular, indicating that the righteous have unity in prayer.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις’ - ‘en tais kardiais’ - ‘in the hearts’. ‘περὶ τῆς ἐν ὑμῖν ἐλπίδος’ - ‘peri tes en hymin elpidos’ - ‘about the hope that you have’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in which; with what’. ‘ἐν Χριστῷ’ - ‘en CHristo’ - ‘in Christ’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in Whom; by Whom’. Both translations are possible: the first indicates that Christ preached while filled with the Holy Spirit, and the second that the Spirit co-operated with Christ in that sermon. We need to remember that God is omnipresent, so He was also in Hades when Christ descended there, and that the Holy Spirit and the Father never left the Son, for the Trinity is indivisible. But while before Christ's descent into Hades God was present there, but not involved, in the Descent God was there as a Participant in the waiting of the faithful and their Redeemer, and in the Resurrection - as the Victor. ‘ἐν φυλακῇ’ - ‘en phylake’ - ‘in prison’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 20 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἡμέραις Νῶε’ - ‘en hemerais Noe’ - ‘in the days of Noah’. ‘εἰς ἣν’ - ‘eis hen’ - ‘in it; (having entered) into it’. The second option is more accurate in meaning, although the word ‘entering’ is not in the text.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 21 &mdash; ‘εἰς θεόν’ - ‘eis theon’ - ‘(directed) to God; to God’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates facing God.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter III, 22 &mdash; ‘ἐν δεξιᾷ θεοῦ’ - ‘en dexia theou’ - ‘at the right hand of God’. ‘εἰς οὐρανόν’ - ‘eis ouranon’ - ‘into heaven’.  
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark XII, 18-27) </reading><br>
Mark XII, 23 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει’ - ‘en te anastasei’ - ‘in the resurrection’. That is, after the general resurrection of the dead.
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 25 &mdash; ‘ὅταν γὰρ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῶσιν’ - ‘hotan gar ek nekron anastosin’ - ‘for when they rise from the dead’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates where the transition is taking place - from the dead to the living. ‘ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς’ - ‘en tois ouranois’ - ‘in the heavens’.
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 26 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως’ - ‘en te biblo Mouseos’ - ‘in the book of Moses’.
