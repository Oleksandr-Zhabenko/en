it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Divine Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Colossians II, 20-III, 3) </reading><br>
Colossians II, 20 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων&#39; — &#39;apo ton stoikheion&#39; - <q>from the elements</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasizes liberation from the elements of the world through dying with Christ. &#39;ἐν κόσμῳ&#39; - &#39;en kosmo&#39; - <q>in the world</q>. Points to life in the world.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 22 — &#39;εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει&#39; - &#39;eis phthoran te apokhresei&#39; - <q>for corruption to using; for destruction to using up</q>. An unusual construction with the dative case, which rather replaces the instrumental — <q>with using</q> (it is known that in koine there was no proper instrumental case, but only 4 basic cases, and the dative can function as instrumental). That is, in meaning — if one uses that, then it leads to corruption and destruction, because it is a sin. Here the recognition and use of religious precepts outside of Christ is called such as leads to corruption and destruction (worsening). If something is designed by God, is good, then using it according to God&#39;s will leads not to destruction, deterioration, but to manifestations of the nature of the created thing and the revelation of its value; here, on the contrary, it is spoken about sin — which does not reveal value, but leads to corruption.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 23 — &#39;ἐν ἐθελοθρησκίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en ethelothreskia&#39; - <q>in self-chosen piety; in self-established piety; in arbitrary worship (religious)</q>. In what. Why does such worship have the appearance of wisdom? Because it resembles true and genuine worship. &#39;ἐν τιμῇ&#39; - &#39;en time&#39; - <q>in honour; with honour</q>. Rather the first option, since it is spoken about spurious <q>elevation</q> of worship.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 1 — &#39;ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;en dexia tou theou&#39; - <q>at the right hand of God</q>. A common expression. That is, in the highest glory and honour, beside the Father.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 3 — &#39;ἐν τῷ θεῷ&#39; - &#39;en to theo&#39; - <q>in God</q>. It emphasizes that this life is in God, holy.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul, as in other places, says that Christians die to sin so that they might live for God — and this is the only way to truly be freed from sin. See about this at the links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Thinking about the heavenly and high in Christ is called to the elevation of the mind, its rebuilding according to the image of God&#39;s mind, when the sins of the world do not surround and embrace the mind, but it rises upward to God, to the purity and clarity prepared by God. This is possible in a wondrous way, through God&#39;s revelations and manifestations, but it mostly happens in the cooperation of God&#39;s will and grace in all things, in particular in cooperation with God regarding the salvation of oneself and other people.

<reading>(Luke IX, 23-27) </reading><br>
Luke IX, 26 — &#39;ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τῶν ἁγίων ἀγγέλων&#39; - &#39;en te doxe autou kai tou patros kai ton hagion angelon&#39; - <q>in His glory, and that of the Father, and of the holy angels</q>. <q>The glory of the holy angels</q> — their multitude and number, their ministry to Christ as God.
