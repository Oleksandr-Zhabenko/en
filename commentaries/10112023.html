A continuation of yesterday's reading, with which it has one verse in common (verse 14), which is referred to here:<br>
<a class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02UxNBiXsyCmPyKafg2uBePVjLVitjqzhZK158NS4WHspMePR9UEQJXsbigNyzB9zfl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02UxNBiXsyCmPyKafg2uBePVjLVitjqzhZK158NS4WHspMePR9UEQJXsbigNyzB9zfl</a><br>
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul encourages the Thessalonians, showing their solidarity in everything with the other Churches, especially in Jerusalem, where the faithful were first to suffer persecution and oppression.<br>
</p>
<p>
He also speaks of personal support, and of the community's personal relationship with Paul.<br>
</p>
<p>
Again he praises the faithful.<br>
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIII, 31-35) </reading><br>
The reading begins with Luke's special account. It is understood that Jesus is not afraid of Herod, but is fulfilling his ministry. He also reveals his intention to go to Jerusalem - to voluntary suffering, death and Resurrection. Also here Jesus appears as a prophet, and the words about the death of a prophet - prophets suffered mainly from power, and power was concentrated in the capital, which was Jerusalem (although it was conquered by the Romans).<br>
</p>
<p>
<q>Fox</q> - it is also noted that in Semitic culture, the fox is a predatory animal, not a cunning one, as, for example, in Ukrainian culture. Herod, who ordered the murder of John the Baptist, who was not interested in the lives of people or the nation (remember that when Jesus was brought to Herod for trial, the latter only wanted to see a miracle, he was not interested in Jesus' destiny as such), deserves a figurative comparison. It is a figurative comparison, i.e. Jesus could have said more fully <q>Herod, who is very much like a fox&hellip;</q>, but Jesus' words are shorter, more decisive, more prophetic - the words of the Lord.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is a parallel passage to verses 34-35 in Matthew (Matthew XXIII, 37-39), which I wrote about here:<br>
