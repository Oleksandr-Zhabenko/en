it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy I, 1-2; 8-18) </reading><br>
2 Timothy I, 1 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; — &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. Indicates that the promise is in Christ Himself.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 2 — &#39;ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ&#39; — &#39;apo Theou Patros kai CHristou Iesou&#39; - <q>from God the Father and Jesus Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that grace, mercy, peace are gifts of God to people.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 9 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; — &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; - <q>in Jesus Christ</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 11 — &#39;εἰς ὃ&#39; — &#39;eis ho&#39; - <q>for which; for it</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 12 — &#39;εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν&#39; — &#39;eis ekeinen ten hemeran&#39; - <q>for that day</q>. That is <q>at the coming of that day</q>. Indicates preparation for eternity.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 13 — &#39;παρ&#39; ἐμοῦ&#39; — &#39;par emou&#39; - <q>from beside me</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; in its form before the following vowel is here with the genitive case. The same construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, also regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html</a><br>

Here this also indicates that Paul&#39;s preaching was from the Holy Spirit. &#39;ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ&#39; — &#39;en pistei kai agape&#39; - <q>in faith and love; with faith and love</q>. The second variant is more figurative and poetic, as if the virtues are eyes. &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; - <q>in Christ Jesus</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 14 — &#39;ἐν ἡμῖν&#39; — &#39;en hemin&#39; - <q>in us</q>. In whom.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 15 — &#39;ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ&#39; — &#39;en te Asia&#39; - <q>in Asia</q>. Where.
</p>

2 Timothy I, 17 — &#39;ἐν Ῥώμῃ σπουδαίως ἐζήτησέν με&#39; — &#39;en Rome spoudaios ezetesen me&#39; - <q>in Rome diligently sought me</q>. Here it is not spoken about <q>arrival in Rome</q>, but about <q>search in Rome</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 18 — &#39;ἔλεος παρὰ κυρίου&#39; — &#39;eleos para kyriou&#39; - <q>mercy from beside the Lord</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the genitive case, the same construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html</a><br>

Here it additionally strengthens the thought through the meaning of recompense from God for seeking Paul (<q>diligently sought me in Rome, found me, may the Lord repay him a hundredfold with mercy</q>). &#39;ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ&#39; — &#39;en ekeine te hemera&#39; - <q>in that day</q>. When. &#39;ἐν Ἐφέσῳ&#39; - &#39;en Epheso&#39; - <q>in Ephesus</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul after greeting calls Timothy to testify boldly about God, about Jesus Christ, also about the work of the Apostle Paul.
</p>
<p>
Paul writes about events with him in his preaching and suffering for Christ. Also he testifies that the Lord decided to gift the faithful with grace even before the creation of the world — that is in His decision even before the creation of time and the world.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XIX, 12-28) </reading><br>
Luke XIX, 12 — &#39;εἰς χώραν μακράν&#39; — &#39;eis khoran makran&#39; - <q>into a far country; into a distant country</q>. Where to. May indicate not distance, but rather a long time until the Second glorious Coming. That is, distance in the parable — an image not of distance, but of time.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 13 — &#39;ἐν ᾧ&#39; — &#39;en ho&#39; - <q>until</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 15 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἐπανελθεῖν&#39; — &#39;en to epanelthein&#39; - <q>when he returned</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 17 — &#39;ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ&#39; — &#39;en elakhisto&#39; - <q>in the least</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 20 — &#39;ἐν σουδαρίῳ&#39; — &#39;en soudario&#39; - <q>in a cloth; in a napkin</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 22 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ στόματός&#39; — &#39;ek tou stomatos&#39; - <q>from the mouth</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; emphasises that the reason for accusation is taken from the words of the servant himself.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 24 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from him</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel shows that it is necessary to take completely, entirely, away.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 26 — &#39;ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ&#39; — &#39;apo de tou&#39; - <q>from him who</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; shows that it will be taken completely, entirely, away.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 28 — &#39;εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα&#39; — &#39;eis Hierosolyma&#39; - <q>to Jerusalem</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
The parable is similar to the parable of the talents in Matthew (Matthew XXV, 14-30), about which I wrote at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19012025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19012025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24092023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24092023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Luke presents additional details, in particular the situation with the inhabitants of the city (here a multifaceted parallel, in particular it can also be understood that this is about demons who rebelled against God and will be judged first, who do not want to have anything in common with God in His goodness, whereas people have these or those relations with God, except enmity).
</p>
<p>
If to understand minas in the broad sense, then there is also meaning in that a person can not only have the image of God as a mina, but also become part of the Church, having received the Sacraments also as a certain mina, and then these at least two minas, if to multiply them and bring forth fruit, will become for the person unto salvation.
