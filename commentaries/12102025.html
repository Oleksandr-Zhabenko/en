it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.

2 Corinthians IX, 7 — &#39;ἐκ λύπης&#39; - &#39;ek lypes&#39; - <q>from pain; from grief; from sorrow; of pain; of grief; of sorrow</q>. Here many translation variants are possible, which also add vivid shades of meaning — one needs to give not because one is prompted to this by pain, grief or sadness, but from mercy and charity, love. &#39;ἐξ ἀνάγκης&#39; - &#39;ex anankes&#39; - <q>from necessity; of necessity</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; also in its form before the following vowel here indicates from where generosity and sacrificial giving are to proceed — not being a burden, but true joy of giving and likeness to God. True generosity here is to be manifested from a complete desire to be likened to the All-generous God, Who endows even with abundance and without sadness through His generosity, completely sincerely.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IX, 8 — &#39;περισσευσαι&#39; - &#39;periesseusai&#39; - <q>to overflow</q>. &#39;εἰς ὑμᾶς&#39; - &#39;eis hymas&#39; - <q>unto you; to you</q>. The movement of God&#39;s grace towards the readers, the faithful is emphasised. &#39;ἐν παντὶ πάντοτε πᾶσαν αὐτάρκειαν&#39; - &#39;en panti pantote pasan autarkeian&#39; - <q>in every matter always all sufficiency</q>. The thought is strengthened by repetitions of similar words. &#39;εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθόν&#39; - &#39;eis pan ergon agathon&#39; - <q>for every good work</q>. That is, the purpose of all sufficiency (whether material or spiritual) is the possibility to do good more and in all ways.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IX, 9 — &#39;εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα&#39; - &#39;eis ton aiona&#39; - <q>unto the age; for ever</q>. Common expression with the meaning of the second translation variant.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IX, 10 — &#39;εἰς βρῶσιν&#39; - &#39;eis brosin&#39; - <q>for food; for sustenance</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose of bread for man.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IX, 11 — &#39;ἐν παντὶ&#39; - &#39;en panti&#39; - <q>in all things</q>. &#39;εἰς πᾶσαν ἁπλότητα&#39; - &#39;eis pasan haploteta&#39; - <q>unto all simplicity; unto all sincerity</q>. That is, enrichment by God&#39;s grace leads to simplicity (ability to fulfil God&#39;s will) and sincerity of love and other virtues.
</p>
<p>
Man is created such that he can be endowed with all grace. More about this is written at the links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Here Paul writes that a person&#39;s generosity in goodness, in good gifts, in help leads to the fact that also the Lord endows the person with His mercies and generosities. First of all this is manifested in graces.
</p>
<p>
Verse 8, words from which are mentioned above, speaks of the fact that one needs to strive for self-sufficiency, but not in separation, isolation (although this can be necessary and needed in case of bad influence for its removal or avoidance), but through mutual participation and help. By this a person can be more likened to God, in the Holy Trinity One.
</p>
<p>
Verse 11 emphasises also the purifying action of generosity and giving — a person who generously and willingly gives, learns simplicity, sincerity, and this greatly promotes and leads a person to purity of heart. Therefore even often all these concepts are mentioned together, and also one often implies the presence also of another (others). A simple and sincere person often also has greater purity.
</p>
<p>
Quotations — from different places of the Old Testament, particularly from psalms and prophets.
</p>
<p>
Paul here almost everywhere, speaking of <q>you</q> (of readers, listeners, addressees), speaks of spiritual life. One can think that the Lord gives spiritual things to people who truly are generous, who give willingly, from a sincere heart, generously.
</p>

<reading>(Luke V, 1-11) </reading><br>
Luke V, 1, 2 — &#39;ἐν τῷ τὸν ὄχλον ἐπικεῖσθαι αὐτῷ καὶ ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;en to ton okhlon epiekisthai auto kai akouein ton logon tou theou&#39; - <q>in the crowd pressing upon Him and hearing the word of God</q>. When. &#39;παρὰ τὴν λίμνην&#39; - &#39;para ten limnen&#39; - <q>to proximity with the lake</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; with accusative, indicates proximity and approach to the lake, that is, Jesus consciously approached the lake, then sat in a boat and preached from the boat. Here one can see a parallel with the preaching of the prophet Jonah (and Simon Peter also was the son of another Jonah), who during the storm acknowledged on the ship that it was because of him. Later, when Christ forgave Peter&#39;s denial, this could again remind Peter of these events and his following Christ.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 2 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;ap auton&#39; - <q>from them</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that the fishermen were at a distance, the boats stood alone abandoned.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 3 — &#39;ἐμβὰς δὲ εἰς ἓν τῶν πλοίων&#39; - &#39;embas de eis hen ton ploion&#39; - <q>and having entered into one boat</q>. Where to. &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς&#39; - &#39;apo tes ges&#39; - <q>from the land</q>. That is, further away. &#39;ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ&#39; - &#39;en to ploio&#39; - <q>in the boat</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 4 — &#39;εἰς τὸ βάθος&#39; - &#39;eis to bathos&#39; - <q>into the deep</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς ἄγραν&#39; - &#39;eis agran&#39; - <q>for catching</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose of action — to catch fish.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἑτέρῳ πλοίῳ&#39; - &#39;en to etero ploio&#39; - <q>in the other boat</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 8 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; ἐμοῦ&#39; - &#39;ap emou&#39; - <q>from me</q>. That is, <q>completely leave me</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 10 — &#39;ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν&#39; - &#39;apo tou nyn&#39; - <q>from now; from now on; henceforth</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
The story of the second calling by Jesus of His closest disciples. About the first one it is written in the Gospel of John I. The apostles after that continued to be fishermen, but also were disciples of Jesus.
</p>
<p>
Here after the miraculous catch of fish, after the miracle which Christ performed, they changed their attitude to all that and came to consider discipleship in Jesus as the main occupation in their life (nevertheless, they continued to be fishermen right up to Pentecost after the Ascension of Jesus).
</p>
<p>
The miracle is multivalent, particularly teaches humility, obedience to God, trust in Him and shows the disciples what the Lord calls them to (to apostolic work).
