it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<reading>(1 Thessalonians IV, 13-17; John V, 24-30) </reading><br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians I, 8-11) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians I, 8 — &#39;ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te Asia&#39; - <q>in Asia</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians I, 9 — &#39;ἐν ἑαυτοῖς&#39; - &#39;en heautois&#39; - <q>in ourselves</q>. In whom, where. That is, inwardly.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians I, 10 — &#39;ἐκ τηλικούτου θανάτου&#39; - &#39;ek telikoutou thanatou&#39; - <q>from such death</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates that Paul and fellow servants already entirely thought that they would suffer death, but the Lord delivered them from that. &#39;εἰς ὃν&#39; - &#39;eis hon&#39; - <q>in Whom; on Whom</q>. By meaning the second translation variant.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians I, 11 — &#39;ἐκ πολλῶν προσώπων&#39; - &#39;ek pollon prosopon&#39; - <q>from many persons</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here that the gift was sincere and substantial. &#39;εἰς ἡμᾶς&#39; - &#39;eis hemas&#39; - <q>to us; for us</q>. All translation variants are possible.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul testifies about difficult dangerous circumstances which happened to him and his fellow servants in Asia, that they already thought they would not remain alive, relied entirely in such circumstances on God the Saviour and Deliverer and on the intercession of the faithful for them in prayers — and the Lord delivered them from those circumstances, so that all would give thanks to God!
</p>
<p>
A lesson of hope in God and prayer, and also then — thanksgiving (gratitude) after God&#39;s help.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke V, 27-32) </reading><br>
Luke V, 29 — &#39;ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;en te oikia autou&#39; - <q>in his house</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 31 — &#39;κακως εχοντες&#39; - &#39;kakos ekhontes&#39; - <q>those who have evil, something really bad</q>. About this expression regarding serious illnesses I wrote in a passage regarding the Gospel of Mark. Luke also, as Mark, relates to the question from the point of view of the perception of the sick person herself. See more at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24082023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24082023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Luke V, 32 — &#39;εἰς μετάνοιαν&#39; - &#39;eis metanoian&#39; - <q>unto repentance; for repentance</q>. Both translation variants are possible. The first indicates repentance as a state, and the second — as a goal.
