<p>Since yesterday was the remembrance of the martyrdom of Saint John
the Baptist, the readings from yesterday are generally carried over to
today, so today we read two readings: (2 Corinthians IX, 12  &ndash; X, 7; VI,
11-16) For the second of these readings, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="23082023.html">23082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>2 Corinthians X, 1  &ndash; ‘θαρρω’  &ndash; ‘tharro’  &ndash; (I) <q>am bold, courageous
(in a good sense)</q>.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians X, 2  &ndash; ‘θαρρησαι’  &ndash; ‘tharresai’  &ndash; ‘would show courage’.
‘ταλμησαι’  &ndash; ‘talmesai’  &ndash; ‘would dare’. The first of the two words is
more about a state of <q>quiet courage</q>, <q>constant courage</q>, while the
second is about a decisive move, a manifestation of courage. ‘ημας’ -
‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’ (we).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians X, 3  &ndash; ‘στρατευομεθα’  &ndash; ‘strateuometha’  &ndash; ‘waging war,
fighting, fighting as soldiers’. From this word we also get ‘strategy’ -
that is, Paul means a reasonable struggle based on reason, not emotion.
The life of the apostles (and the believers who are like them) is like a
large-scale overcoming of evil. Paul goes on to say that the spiritual
weapons of the faithful are powerful to pull down fortresses (capable of
overcoming large and widespread evil).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians X, 4  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians X, 7  &ndash; ‘εμεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>From the reading we see that the apostles were meek in their personal
behaviour, but bold in their preaching. Some people thought that the
apostles’ meekness was a weakness, but Paul shows that this approach is
strong against large evil. At the same time, the apostles can dare to
act decisively if necessary.</p>
<p>At the beginning, he encourages the believers to help the faithful in
need, whom he calls saints (for the sake of God’s grace among them, the
believers themselves are not necessarily saints personally).</p>

<p><reading>(Mark III, 20-27; I, 23-28) </reading>

<p>I wrote earlier about the parallel passage in Matthew to the second
part of the first Gospel reading today here:
<br><a class="link2" href="04072023.html">04072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Mark III, 26  &ndash; ‘εμερισθη’  &ndash; ‘emeristhe’  &ndash; ‘divided, parted’.</p>
<p>The Lord continues His ministry, heals, casts out demons, and here
overcomes the objections of the Pharisees and scribes to miracles.</p>
<p>The Church of the Virgin Mary in honour of Her icon <q>Pantanassa</q>
(‘Queen-of-Everything’): (Philippians II, 5-11, Luke X, 38-42; XI,
27-28) For these frequent readings on the feasts in honour of the Mother
of God, see the link:

<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
