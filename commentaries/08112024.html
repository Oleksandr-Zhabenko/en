it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Hebrews II, 2-10) </reading><br>
Hebrews II, 3 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων’ - ‘hypo ton akousanton’ - ‘through those who heard’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case, indicating the participation of the hearers. ‘εἰς ἡμᾶς’ - ‘eis emas’ - ‘’in us; to us‘’. Both translations are possible, with the second emphasising that this is a gift from God to the faithful.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 7, 9 &mdash; ‘παρ’ ἀγγέλους - ‘par angelous’ - ‘to proximity with angels; alongside angels’. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the next vowel here is with an accusative, has the meaning of comparison, juxtaposition.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ γὰρ ὑποτάξαι’ - ‘en to gar ypotaxai’ - ‘since He has subdued, subjected’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews II, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς δόξαν’ - ‘eis doxan’ - ‘to glory’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here where the Lord has brought His children.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke X, 16-21) </reading><br>
Luke X, 17 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί’ - ‘en to onomati’ - ‘in the name; by the name’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating what the demons obey for - ‘for the sake of the name’, in fact, for the power given by Christ and exercised through His name, and the second indicating by what the disciples exercise the power they have received from Christ.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ’ - ‘ek tou ouranou’ - ‘from heaven’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where the devil fell from.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 20 &mdash; ‘ἐν τούτῳ’ - ‘en touto’ - ‘in that; by that’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating the perception of power over spirits as a state in which the disciples are, and the second as an object of joy, something that rejoices the disciples. ‘ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς’ - ‘en tois ouranois’ - ‘in the heavens; by the heavens’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that the Lord gave glory to each apostle, and more generally to the disciples, in the heavens, and the second that the apostles and faithful disciples of Christ have an eternal, enduring significance, a heavenly glory that they manifest to the world. The struggle with the evil one will cease in the Kingdom of God, but this glory will last forever.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 21 &mdash; ‘Ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ’ - ‘En aute te ora’ - ‘at that hour; then’. A common expression. ‘ἐν τῷ πνεύματι’ - ‘en to pneumati’ - ‘in the Spirit; by the Spirit’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating more of a staying in the Spirit, while the second indicates that the Holy Spirit delighted Jesus. Here the reference is to the personal relationship between the Son and the Spirit. ‘ἀπὸ σοφῶν’ - ‘apo sophon’ - ‘from the wise’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that those wise ones stood aside and therefore did not receive from God what would have been in line with the opinion of the people about them.
