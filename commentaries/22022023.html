<p>Roman Catholics today have Ash Wednesday, Lent began (this year until
April 9), For the Greek Orthodox Christians, the last preparatory week
for fasting continues. Easter for the Orthodox and Greek Catholics this
year is on April 16.</p>
<p>From now on, services are served as in the time of Lent. On Monday
Lent begins. During weekdays of fasting (which are included in the
number of 40 days of multi-day fasting) there are no liturgical readings
from the New Testament, but psalms and Old Testament books are read,
including the prophetic, teaching, and book of Genesis.</p>

<p><reading>(Joel II, 12-26, III, 12-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>Today there were no New Testament
readings, but there was a reading from the book of the prophet Joel, one
of the 12 little prophets. The prophet calls to fasting, remembering the
Israelites of God mercy. In the time of the prophet Joel, the Gospel
word was not yet heard, so the Israelites often fasted in sorrow.
Fasting in its own sense was a time of spiritual focus, for the sake of
restoration, improvement of relations with God, for the sake of
purification, a preparatory time. Fasting was a kind of <q>impulse</q>,
<q>impetus</q> for renewal the relationship with God. Over time, the
Pharisees began to perceive fasting in a completely different way, for
which they were exposed by Christ. And now Joel calls precisely to that
inner, heartfelt <q>impulse</q>.</p>
<p>The second thing Joel says is that the Lord by His actions will lead
to the successful fulfillment of His will and give blessings.</p>
<p>I will also dwell on one detail. On September 30, 2022, I wrote about
trumpet and voice, about music given the Gospel words.

<p>Joel speaks of trumpet in the context of strong crying, even sobbing.
Recalling what was written in that publication, I think that in words
<q>do not trumpet ahead of yourself</q> — <q>trumpeting</q> in relation to singing
does not mean enough controlled sound, voice. <q>ahead of yourself</q> and
<q>yourself</q> is called not only good control of voice, sound, but also
expressiveness, the ability to convey and <q>be oneself in sound</q>, which
are expressed in the voice. Perhaps it is advisable to try to ensure
that the voice can be clearly associated with oneself (<q>I</q>). I think to
achieve this actually, in depth, perhaps in connection with all life,
that is, is possible only holistically as a person. And the Lord wants,
among all things, also that we be whole in good.</p>
