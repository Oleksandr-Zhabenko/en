it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Thessalonians V, 14-23) </reading><br>
For the reading from the Apostle, see the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17012026.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17012026.html</a><br>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XVII, 3-10) </reading><br>
Luke XVII, 4 — &#39;εἰς σὲ&#39; - &#39;eis se&#39; - <q>against you</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the directedness of the action of sin, that is, to sin concerning whom, against whom, therefore such translation.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 6 — &#39;ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ&#39; - &#39;en te thalasse&#39; - <q>in the sea</q>. Where, and not whither. It is spoken not about an impulsive action, but about a calm one. This emphasises the miraculousness and extraordinariness — if it is very difficult to imagine that a fig tree itself plants itself in the sea, in an entirely unnatural environment for it, but one can see an analogy with an impulsive action of a person, who can do something unthinkingly, even harmful or threatening to themselves, then here it is yet more wondrous — the fig tree does not act instantly, impulsively, but calmly, as if thoughtfully, so, as if it is going to live there in the sea. This implicit detail emphasises yet greater miraculousness and power.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 7 — &#39;Τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;Tis de ex hymon&#39; - <q>Who then of you</q>. An interrogative construction. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;hy&#39; indicates here that it is spoken about a representative of the group of disciples, one of them. &#39;ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ&#39; - &#39;ek tou agrou&#39; - <q>from the field</q>. From where he will return.
</p>
<p>
Luke briefly presents at once several teachings of Jesus, about which in Matthew and Mark there is more.

I believe that one can draw an analogy with the words about faith also for love — if we had love, then we… would blossom. When I wanted to write about this thought to a girl named Juul, I reflected. Here it is necessary to understand that these are motivational words of Christ. He does not use them as a way to say: <q>Behold you do not have faith (love)</q>, but invites to acquire such faith (love). These words, thus, are motivational: the disciples ask to add faith, and Christ instead of a miracle or something else invites to the acquisition of such faith (love). In view of that written in the work above about the power of human this is entirely logical: if the Lord gives such faith, such love, grants it, then the disciples and the faithful (in particular also us) need to accept it. Then there is no need to ask Him for more faith (love), but one needs to attain them through the invitation of Christ. And if for something there is no God&#39;s will, God&#39;s desire, then the Lord has no intention to grant that which will be inappropriate. In general Christ wishes that we have faith (love), therefore He invites. The words of Christ, being true, invite.

Further the Lord teaches humility. Here humility is presented as such which arises from the awareness of the incomparable difference between God and people, between the Creator and creation. Also here it is spoken about humility before God. Between people no difference is made, that is, humility in this reading from the Gospel generally does not speak about humility in relations with other people, but only with God. At the same time it is impossible to call whole the vision and life of a person who is humble, as described here, before God, but exalts themselves, places themselves above over other people. Concerning this second component it is spoken more in other places of the Gospel and the Epistles, in particular see by the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/14122024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/14122024.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16122023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16122023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Here they note the parallel with Proverbs XXV, 6. There it is spoken about not exalting oneself in the presence of the king.
</p>
<p>
The Lord Jesus more deeply reveals this thought in that not only in the presence of the king ought one to be modest, but also in general.
</p>
<p>
The general thought of that is that the faithful ought not to be ambitious, at the same time one does not need to be ashamed or to refuse true honour. In detail about humility see by the link:<br>
