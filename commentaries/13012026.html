it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(James III, 1-10) </reading><br>
James III, 2 — &#39;ἐν λόγῳ&#39; - &#39;en logo&#39; - <q>in word; with word</q>. Both variants of translation are possible.
</p>
<p>
James III, 3 — &#39;χαλινοὺς εἰς τὰ στόματα&#39; - &#39;khalinous eis ta stomata&#39; - <q>bridles into the mouths</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς τὸ πείθεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἡμῖν&#39; - &#39;eis to peithesthai autous hemin&#39; - <q>for their obedience to us</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
James III, 4 — &#39;ὑπὸ ἀνέμων σκληρῶν ἐλαυνόμενα&#39; - &#39;hypo anemon skleron elaunomena&#39; - <q>by strong wind being driven</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle <q>being driven</q>. &#39;μετάγεται ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου πηδαλίου&#39; - &#39;metagetai hypo elakhistou pedaliou&#39; - <q>are turned by a very small rudder</q>. Analogously to the previous the preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the verb, translated as <q>are turned</q> (by what?).
</p>
<p>
James III, 6 — &#39;ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν&#39; - &#39;en tois melesin hemon&#39; - <q>among our members</q>. Where. &#39;φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης&#39; - &#39;phlogizomene hypo tes geennes&#39; - <q>being set on fire by gehenna</q>. That is by the place of eternal torment.
</p>
<p>
James III, 9 — &#39;ἐν αὐτῇ&#39; - &#39;en aute&#39; - <q>with it</q>. With what.
</p>
<p>
James III, 10 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ στόματος&#39; - &#39;ek tou autou stomatos&#39; - <q>from the same mouth</q>. From where. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here from where that comes out. The source actually is the heart of the person, but words come out through speech.
</p>
<p>
James speaks about speech, about the tongue as a part of the body, about its significance. A complex and saturated place, only small comments.
</p>
<p>
<q>teachers</q> — in view of what follows, a peculiar <q>definition of the apostle James</q>: <q>teacher — a person who allows to master information flows</q>.
</p>
<p>
A person has learned to master the forces of nature, to tame animals etc., but no one among people can make it so that all people could analogously conveniently master the sphere of information, so that all could always speak the truth, so that all would know the truth (in any branch and realm), so that all would not sin by words and thoughts. And that person who succeeds in this at least in some part, they can be a teacher, they are also called perfect in James.
</p>
<p>
About words and their significance regarding another place of Scripture there is a good work on August 6, 2022 on my page.<br>

<p>
I quote.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XII, 35-36
</p>
<p>
<q>Treasure</q> — literally <q>treasury</q>, originally — a building where valuable things are kept, a modern jewelry vault, possibly a bank or something similar. A person sins with words, because they <q>bring out</q> outwardly verbally their <q>bad treasures</q>, and conversely — speaks well, bringing out <q>good treasures</q>. Treasures — can be understood not that it is truly valuable, but that the person has attachment, a certain close connection with it, as if it were a treasure, a valuable thing. One can be attached to evil as to a treasure, and so it is when a person sins with words. Also one can see how one needs to relate to words: they are like jewelry items, certain ornaments, which can be both good and bad (for example, ornaments cruel, aggressive, threatening, false etc.). When a person speaks — they give to listeners (readers) such ornaments.
</p>
<p>
To overcome the sin of evil speech, one needs to cleanse the heart from evil, about which I wrote more in the work <q>About Adultery. Full Version</q>.
</p>
<p>
<q>Idle</q> — literally <q>inactive, inactive, lazy</q> (in Slavonic <q>праздное</q>), which is also <q>vain</q>. That is a word which has no purpose, does not perform some action, <q>just a word</q>, <q>just to be</q>. As I said earlier, it is impossible to be neutral regarding Christ, regarding good — a person is always either for or against, therefore <q>idle</q> words actually are in no way <q>idle</q> or <q>neutral</q>.
</p>

<reading>(Mark X, 2-12) </reading><br>
Mark X, 6 — &#39;ἀπὸ δὲ ἀρχῆς&#39; — &#39;apo de arkhes&#39; - <q>from the beginning</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here the beginning, from which moment of time the count begins for what is described.
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 8 — &#39;οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν&#39; — &#39;oi dyo eis sarka mian&#39; - <q>the two into one flesh; the two for one flesh</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates movement and transformation or the purpose — so that the two become one flesh. The words <q>flesh</q> and <q>body</q> are often synonyms, but also what is used here can mean that it is spoken about marriage as an earthly union, not a heavenly one, and therefore these words concern every lawful, even non-sacramental marriage of man and woman (the apostle Paul in the Epistles develops the thought so that he compares marriage with the Mystery of Christ and the Church, using the word <q>Body</q>, and on the other hand speaks about bodily union which occurs even in cases of sins and lawlessness).
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 10 — &#39;εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν&#39; — &#39;eis ten oikian&#39; - <q>(having come) into the house; in the house; at home</q>. Having come where to.
