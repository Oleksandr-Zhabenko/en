<p>I congratulate all Christians who celebrate the Dormition of the
Mother of God (according to the Roman Catholic Tradition, the Assumption
of the Blessed Virgin Mary) on this great holiday!</p>

<p><reading>(2 Corinthians II, 14  &ndash; III, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians II, 14  &ndash; ‘ημας’ -
‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’. ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; (through) ‘us’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III:2, 3  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; (of) ‘us’ (our, ours).
‘εγγεγραμμενη’  &ndash; ‘engegrammene’  &ndash; ‘written’.</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s reading, which I wrote about at the
link, including an explanation of the first verse in the reading:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="14082023.html">14082023.html</a></p>
<p><q>So, if a person smells an odour, willingly or not, at least once,
then so also is the preaching of the apostles  &ndash; if people accept it,
they are saved, and if they reject it, they are moving towards the
perishing. But they cannot be indifferent or ignore it.</p>
<p>Verse 15 of chapter II also has a deeper meaning  &ndash; the distinction of
the apostles among all people through Christ. That is, they are special
in Christ among all people  &ndash; both those who will be saved and those who
will perish, that is, among all people without exception (for every
person will either be saved or perish, there is no third way, tertium
non datum).</p>
<p>So, we can see here Paul’s testimony that, apart from the apostles
(perhaps apart from faithful Christians), there will be people who will
be saved  &ndash; in Christ, but not in conscious obedience to Christ (for
example, they may simply not know about Him). But in general, this is a
difficult place to understand, one might say disputable.</p>
<p>Then there is one of the most beautiful and poetic metaphors in
Scripture  &ndash; the image of Christ’s letter of trust written on the fleshly
tables of the heart not with ink, but with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We can say that when the Holy Spirit works through Jesus Christ in
humane and pure-hearted believers (at least good-hearted ones) thanks to
the work of the apostles, they themselves become a confirmation of the
truth of the words and preaching of the apostles through whom they
received the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>There is also a meaning here for the Sacraments of Anointing and
Priesthood. After all, it is through the Holy Spirit that they are
mainly performed, renewing a person with His gifts from within.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXIII, 23-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>Continuation of yesterday’s reading, exposing
the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes.

<p>I wrote earlier, see the link (and others quoted there):

<p>To the apostle and first martyr Stephen, the first deacon:<br>
<reading>(Acts VI,
8  &ndash; VII, 5, 47-60; Matthew XXI, 33-42) </reading><br>
 Matthew XXI, 42  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’
- ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>I wrote about the readings from the Apostle earlier, see here:

<p>The quote about the cornerstone is found in Isaiah XXVIII, 16 and
Psalm CXVIII, 22. I previously wrote about the context of the prophecy
in Isaiah:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="23032023.html">23032023.html</a></p>
<p>Since the first martyr Stephen, and many other martyrs after him,
suffered, being Christ-like, remaining faithful to God, a parable is
read that promises God’s deliverance of the faithful from evil.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
