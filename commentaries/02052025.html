it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts XXI, 8-14) </reading><br>
Acts XXI, 8 — ‘εἰς Καισαρίαν’ - ‘eis Kaisarian’ - <q>to Caesarea</q>. To where. 'εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦ ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ' - <q>eis ton oikon Philippou tou euangelistou ontos ek ton hepta</q> - ‘into the house of Philip, the evangelist, one of the seven (first deacons, please refer to chapter VIII for more information about him)’. Where to. The preposition <q>ek</q> here indicates that Philip is a representative of the first deacons, similar to the others. 'παρ' αὐτῷ' - ‘par auto’ - <q>in the vicinity of him; with him</q>. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the following vowel here is wth the dative case and indicates being near him, that is, as close friends, welcome visitors.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXI, 10 — ‘ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας’ - ‘apo tes Ioudaias’ - <q>from Judea</q>. From where. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that Agabus left Judea at that time.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXI, 11 — ‘ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ’ - ‘en Hierousalem’ - <q>in Jerusalem</q>. Where. ‘εἰς χεῖρας ἐθνῶν’ - ‘eis kheiras ethnon’ - <q>into the hands of the Gentiles</q>. Where to. The preposition ‘eis’ is part of a common expression here.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXI, 12 — <q>εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ</q> - <q>eis Hierousalem</q> - ‘into Jerusalem’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXI, 13 — <q>ἀποθανεῖν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἑτοίμως ἔχω</q> - <q>apothanein eis Hierousalem etoimos ekho</q> - <q>ready to die (go) to Jerusalem; to die? (I am going) to Jerusalem! I am ready (prepared)!</q>. The preposition <q>eis</q> here indicates Paul's determination to go and preach Christ, even if it could lead to martyrdom. Agabus' words were indeed from the Holy Spirit, as was Paul's determination. The ministry of the apostleship, the preaching of Christ, is so important and commanded by Christ that even spiritual warnings are not decisive in determining whether or not to preach.
