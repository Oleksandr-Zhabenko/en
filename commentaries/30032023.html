<p><reading>(Isaiah XLII, 5-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Just above was the prophecy about the Son of God,
which is quoted by the evangelist Matthew.</p>
<p>And here is the continuation.</p>
<p>Isaiah XLII, 5  &ndash; here a distinction is made between <q>breath</q> and
<q>spirit</q> in people. Also not active person can <q>breathe</q> (but he / she
must be alive), and <q>spirit</q> here is synonymous with activity. There is
more about the spirit in the work at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://sites.google.com/view/rozdumy23/na-slova-hristovi-pilnujte-j-molitsa-sob-ne-vpasti-v-spokusu---badorij-bo-duh-ale-nemicne-tilo">https://sites.google.com/view/rozdumy23/na-slova-hristovi-pilnujte-j-molitsa-sob-ne-vpasti-v-spokusu—badorij-bo-duh-ale-nemicne-tilo</a><br>
Generally speaking, it is not a question of what constitutes human
nature, but of those chosen among the gifts with which God bestows human
in His care.</p>
<p>Further, ambiguous words  &ndash; on the other hand, refer to Israel as a
nation through which the Lord bestows mercy on the whole world, but also
on Jesus Christ, in Whom the Lord bestows mercy on the whole world. The
latter is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Further, under different people, we see how the Lord will spread the
faith  &ndash; through apostles-fishermen (many of them), hermit monks (later),
in different parts of the earth (all over the world).</p>
<p>At the same time, we see that the prophecy is about the Lord Himself,
about Jesus Christ, Who defeated sin and death.</p>
<p>Even further in Isaiah XLII, 14 is a prophecy about God’s
long-suffering, and about the sufferings on the cross and the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, Isaiah XLII, 16 is a prophecy that the Lord will teach
people and give strength, and that it will be forever, for the
everlasting eternity.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis XVIII, 20-33) </reading>
</p>
<p>Again, the part is omitted, where, in
particular, in addition to the continuation of yesterday’s reading, it
is said that the beginning of a new appearance of God to Abraham and
Sarah near the oak of Mamre.</p>
<p>Many believe that the three Angels are the appearance of the Holy
Trinity — the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit — to Abraham, that
this is the only such appearance in the Old Testament, there are even
icons on this topic. This opinion is also indicated by the fact (as the
researchers note) that Abraham meets the Three, but addresses <q>Lord</q> as
One (but this fact allows other interpretations, except for this
traditional Christian one, although they are weaker in terms of
<q>expressiveness</q>). Also, the Lord knows the thoughts of people’s hearts
(Sarah), which is characteristic only of God (and of creation  &ndash; only by
grace, if the heart is not one’s own). For Christians, these arguments
are quite enough to think that the Holy Trinity has appeared. At the
same time, the opinion is also widespread that it was One of the
Hypostases of the Trinity (Son of God, because Isaac is His image, which
will be read tomorrow about) and two angels. Abraham appealed to the
Lord. And the Lord spoke to him.</p>
<p>The missed reading is also about the promise that the son will be
born already within a year  &ndash; that is, the conception will take place in
the near future. It is also omitted that Sarah laughed in her heart, not
believing, and then, having received a rebuke from the Seer of the Heart
(from God), came to know the truth better.</p>
<p>In general, history serves as an example and science of faith,
knowledge of God, self-knowledge, hospitality (why hospitality is often
called <q>Abrahamic</q> as a sign of its virtue and value), as well as
intercession for people, prayer, love.</p>
<p>And the reading itself speaks of God’s intention to descend on the
sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to execute judgment. Also about the
intercession of Abraham. We see that Abraham asks in prayer, as an
insignificant person  &ndash; as a simple slave. This is because he knows how
sinful people lived there, and also because he knows that the Lord will
fulfill His will. He definitely wants to save Lot and his family,
thought of the salvation of the other people, while at the same time
trusting God completely. In general, this is a lesson in prayer and
intercession for sinners  &ndash; a person entrusts to God’s mercy and justice,
and at the same time draws closer to God: at first, as if from afar, and
then closer.</p>
<p>It must be said that the Lord really saved Lot and his family (the
wife died because of her own unbelief and condemnation of God, which she
did after seeing the heavenly punishment).</p>
<p>And the complicated story of Lot is lowered.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs XVI, 17  &ndash; XVII, 17) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Greek and Hebrew texts differ
markedly, but are generally similar.</p>
<p>In general, reading about wisdom, prudence, the ability to speak and
silence, restraint, humility, modesty, righteousness, charity, kindness,
gentleness, rejoice, a good godly life, and about sins and vices that
harm these virtues.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good verses, I’ll stop at just two.</p>
<p>Proverbs XVI, 19 — the source, cause of success is not less important
than the success itself. If the cause of success is fall, sin, calamity,
and the like, then such success is actually worse than failure without
evil. Evil cannot make a truly successful person. In the Gospel, this
general idea is revealed much deeper, there we see that humility leads
to true happiness, bliss, the Source of which is God Himself.</p>
<p>Proverbs XVII, 5  &ndash; again against pride, arrogance, gloating,
unmercifulness. Rejoicing in the eternal destruction of people is
sinful, no matter who those people are. But to the extent that other
states are associated with such joy, to that extent they are also
sinful. <q>God does not desire the death of sinners, but that they repent
and be alive (in eternity),</q> says another place of Scripture.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
