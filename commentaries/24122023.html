<reading>(Matthew I, 1-25) </reading><br>
The genealogy of Jesus Christ shows that He was the promised Messiah that Israel had been waiting for. 
</p>
<p>
It includes different people to show that Christ came to save everyone.
</p>
<p>
It is also the story of Christmas itself.

</p>
<p>
Matthew gives a very brief account of the story of Christmas itself, focusing more on the fact that Jesus' birth was in accordance with the Law and the Prophets.

<p>
According to the Church's understanding, the Son of God becomes a human being so that people may become gods by grace, children of God through the gift of adoption to God in the image of the Only Begotten Son of God.
</p>
<p>
Now I will briefly focus on one issue that is also worthy of attention.
</p>
<p>
The Incarnation of the Son of God shows, among other things, that God acts by His grace on people of all ages, and Christ took upon Himself our condition &mdash; that of children, young people, and mature people, and during His suffering and death on the cross, we can say and see that He also took upon Himself the condition of the old and weak, who also suffer pain and agony. In other words, we see that although people's awareness of themselves changes, God acts by His grace at all ages.

<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
