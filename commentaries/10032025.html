it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah IV, 2 &mdash; V, 7) </reading><br>
Isaiah IV, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐπιλάμψει ὁ θεὸς ἐν βουλῇ μετὰ δόξης’ - ‘epilampsei ho theos en boule meta doxes’ - ‘God will shine in will with glory; God will shine in council with glory; God will come in council with glory’. There are different translations, but this is the Coming of God Himself, which is a much clearer indication that Christ is God and a prophecy of His two Comings.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah IV, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν Σιων’ - ‘en Sion’ - ‘in Zion’. ‘ἐν Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘en Ierousalem’ - ‘in Jerusalem’. ‘πάντες οἱ γραφέντες εἰς ζωὴν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘pantes hoi graphentes eis zoen en Ierousalem’ - ‘all those who are written for living in Jerusalem’. A parallel with the Book of Life in Revelation, where the saints, those who will be saved, are recorded.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah IV, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν’ - ‘ek mesou auton’ - ‘from among him’. ‘ἐν πνεύματι κρίσεως καὶ πνεύματι καύσεως’ - ‘en pneumati kriseos kai pneumati kauseos’ - ‘in the Spirit of judgement and the Spirit of burning; with the Spirit of judgement and the Spirit of burning; with the Spirit of justice and the Spirit of burning’. Different translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah IV, 6 &mdash; ‘ἔσται εἰς σκιὰν ἀπὸ καύματος καὶ ἐν σκέπῃ καὶ ἐν ἀποκρύφῳ ἀπὸ σκληρότητος καὶ ὑετοῦ’ - ‘estai eis skian apo kaumatos kai en skepe kai en apokrypho apo sklerotetos kai hyetou’ - ‘will be for the tent from the burning heat, and protection and shelter from the hardness and shower’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates who the Lord will be for the faithful, and the preposition ‘apo’ here indicates what He will protect them from.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν κέρατι ἐν τόπῳ πίονι’ - ‘en kerati en topo pioni’ - literally ‘in the horn in a fertile place’. The meaning is ‘on a fertile mountain top’, in the best conditions for a vineyard.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν μέσῳ’ - ‘en meso’ - ‘in the midst’ (where). ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in it’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘en Ierousalem’ - ‘in Jerusalem’. ‘ἐν ἐμοὶ’ - ‘en emoi’ - ‘between Me; (in the matter of) Me’. That is, in the judgement of God and His vineyard.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 5 &mdash; ‘εἰς διαρπαγήν’ - ‘eis diarpagen’ - ‘to tear in pieces’. ‘εἰς καταπάτημα’ - ‘eis katapatema’ - ‘’for trampling; for despising‘’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς αὐτὸν ὡς εἰς χέρσον ἄκανθα’ - ‘eis auton os eis kherson akantha’ - ‘in it as a waste of land by the thorns’. This refers to the fact that thorns will grow, wasting the land and turning it into a desert. ‘εἰς αὐτὸν’ - ‘eis auton’ - ‘for him’.

</p>
<p>
At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis III, 21 &mdash; IV, 7) </reading><br>
Genesis III, 22 &mdash; ‘ὡς εἷς ἐξ ἡμῶν’ - ‘hos heis ex hemon’ - ‘as one of Us’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel here indicates a choice among several persons, hypostases. An indication of the Trinity. ‘εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα’ - ‘eis ton aiona’ - ‘for ever’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Genesis III, 23 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ παραδείσου’ - ‘ek tou paradeisou’ - ‘from paradise’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where Adam and Eve were expelled from, but emphasises that they ‘came from’ paradise, were called to it, and also indicates that they did not lose all that was in paradise, they still had some of those gifts. ‘ἐξ ἧς ἐλήμφθη’ - ‘ex hes elemphthe’ - ‘from which he was taken’. Here, the preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘he’ indicates that he was taken from the earth, i.e. ‘from whence’.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IV, 3 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν τῆς γῆς’ - ‘apo ton karpon tes ges’ - ‘from the fruit of the earth’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it was a gift to God, a complete offering of these fruits. It also implies that it was not so much the fruit that was a gift (for all the earth is the Lord's), but Cain's will to offer God a sacrifice from his labour.
</p>
<p>
Genesis iv, 4 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν πρωτοτόκων τῶν προβάτων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν στεάτων αὐτῶν’ - ‘apo ton prototokon ton probaton autou kai apo ton steaton auton’ - ‘from the firstborn of his lambs and from the fat (lard) of them’. Similar to the previous verse in verse 3. The Lord accepted Abel's offering not because of the fat or the lambs, but because Abel's will was better than Cain's. Paul writes about Abel's faith, and John writes about his good works.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs III, 34 &mdash; IV, 22) </reading><br>
Proverbs IV, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν προσώπῳ μητρός’ - ‘en prosopo metros’ - ‘in the face of the mother; with the face of the mother’. In other words, he had a close relationship of maternal love, his mother loved him and he loved her.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IV, 4 &mdash; ‘εἰς σὴν καρδίαν’ - ‘eis sen kardian’ - ‘for your heart’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IV, 13 &mdash; ‘εἰς ζωήν’ - ‘eis zoen’ - ‘for life’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IV, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in which; by which’. ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῶν' - <q>ap auton</q> - <q>from it</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that one must completely abandon that path, leave it entirely.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs IV, 21 &mdash; ‘ἐν σῇ καρδίᾳ’ - ‘en se kardia’ - ‘in your heart’.
