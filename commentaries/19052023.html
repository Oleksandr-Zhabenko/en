<p><reading>(Acts XV, 5-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts XV, 8  &ndash; ‘εμαρτυρησεν’  &ndash; ‘emartυresen’  &ndash; ‘bore
witness’  &ndash; from ‘μαρτυρεω’  &ndash; ‘martureo’  &ndash; ‘to testify’.</p>
<p>Acts XV, 31  &ndash; literally <q>rejoiced in (over) the encouragement</q>. The
decision of the Apostolic Council was joyfully accepted by the Church as
the joy and encouragement of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The reading on the First Apostolic Council in Jerusalem in 51 A.D.
The reading is detailed, but the speeches are brief. The opinions of the
representatives of different schools of thought (James -
Judeo-Christian, Paul and Barnabas  &ndash; Christian, Peter  &ndash; as <q>combining</q>
the first and the second, although Peter did not study at them)
converged in the common decision of the Council. I wrote more about
their understanding of the issue in my previous works on the readings
before the beginning of Lent, so I will not dwell on it in detail
now.</p>
<p>I will note that in fact, the ritual components of the Old Testament
for Christians from the Gentiles were almost completely removed, while
the ethical and faith aspects were preserved. As Christ says in the
Gospels, <q>judgement, mercifulness and faith</q>.</p>
<p>Not all the sins from which one should avoid or distance oneself are
named, but those that were either very common (ubiquitous), or those
that led directly back to paganism, or those whose absence would sharply
contradict Old Testament godliness and spirituality (the prohibition to
eat blood). For example, there is no prohibition against stealing in the
Resolution not because it was permitted (no, it is not allowed, it is a
sin!), but because the Gentiles also recognised this commandment in its
general form (without details). Therefore, we need to understand that it
was these rules that distinguished Christians of that time from Gentiles
and Jews the most.</p>

<p><reading>(John X, 17-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>John X, 18, 25  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘Me’. ‘εμαυτου’ -
‘emautou’  &ndash; ‘Myself’.</p>
<p>John X, 22  &ndash; ‘ενκανια’  &ndash; ‘enkania’  &ndash; ’the Feast of Dedication,
Rededication (in honour of the renewal of religious service after the
Antiochian (Syrian) captivity).</p>
<p>John X, 24  &ndash; ‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘plainly, openly, frankly,
freely, boldly, all-autspokened, confidently’.</p>
<p>John X, 26  &ndash; ‘εμων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘Me’ (‘My’).</p>
<p>John X, 27  &ndash; ‘εμα’  &ndash; ‘ema’  &ndash; ‘Me’ (‘My’).</p>
<p>Jesus’ response to the Jews denies their desire to <q>make Him guilty
of the disputes among them about Him</q>. Instead of seriously examining
the matter, they are guided by stereotypes (<q>demon</q>, <q>madman</q>).</p>
<p>The Lord is speaking about His ministry.</p>
<p>To the righteous Job the long-suffering and to the reverend Job of
Pochayiv: (Galatians V, 22  &ndash; VI, 2) See a brief explanation here:

<p><reading>(Luke VI, 17-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>The commandments of bliss are briefly presented, as
well as compassion for those who live contrary to them. I will not dwell
on this in detail now.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
