it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

The research material is currently being prepared for publication. I hope, God willing, to present fuller results later after the publication comes out.

<reading>(Luke XII, 16-21) </reading><br>
Luke XII, 17 — &#39;ἐν ἑαυτῷ&#39; — &#39;en heauto&#39; - <q>within himself</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 19 — &#39;εἰς ἔτη πολλά&#39; — &#39;eis ete polla&#39; - <q>for many years</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 20 — &#39;ἀπὸ σοῦ&#39; — &#39;apo sou&#39; - <q>from you</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that it will be taken completely, entirely.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 21 — &#39;εἰς θεὸν&#39; — &#39;eis theon&#39; - <q>towards God; in the direction of God; for God</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; emphasises not that <q>God is as if a treasury of good</q>, but that we should move towards God, He is the Goal of movement and life.
</p>
<p>
A parable about how a person can become captivated by the material, forgetting about God, and captivation with one&#39;s own material well-being can prevent a person even from helping other people. Then the death of such a person or the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will reveal that what the person unreasonably appropriated for themselves is in reality insufficient for eternity, and the material goods themselves will often be distributed not as would have pleased that person.
</p>
<p>
Verse 21 more precisely literally sounds like: <q>so it is with the one who stores up treasures for themselves, and does not become rich towards (in the direction, as a point of destination, goal) God</q>.
</p>
<p>
The generalised language about <q>the one</q> speaks precisely about the generality of the described situation — it concerns all, and not only those with whom precisely such happened.
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ urges to care first of all about life with God. <q>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and everything else will be added to you</q>, — He says in another Gospel.
