<p><reading>(Acts XXVIII, 1-31) </reading>
</p>
<p>Completion of the book of the Acts of the Saint
Apostles.</p>
<p>Paul`s and his companions’ visit to Malta. The miracle with the
serpent, the healing of the ruler and many of the inhabitants. The
Maltese, who were religious Gentiles at the time, showed great honour to
the Apostle Paul after the miracles, and before that great
hospitality.</p>
<p>It also describes the journey on to Rome and the preaching among the
Jews there.</p>
<p>Acts XXVIII, 18  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (in) ‘me’.</p>
<p>Acts XXVIII, 31  &ndash; ‘περρησιας’  &ndash; ‘parresias’  &ndash; ‘all-outspokenness,
freedom, boldness, confidence, openness, frankness’.</p>

<p><reading>(John XXI, 15-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The forgiveness and the new threefold calling of Peter, the
foretelling of his death for Christ, and the testimony concerning the
beloved disciple of Jesus and the author of the Gospel, John the
Theologian.</p>
<p>A deep place that can be understood in different ways.</p>
<p>Important details are the distinction between the types of love  &ndash; ”
philia” and <q>agape</q>. The place does not allow us to see this or that
kind of love as superior. Many people believe that philia as love is
more emotional than agape. But I would like to point out that philia is
associated with greater worries, is more dramatic in Peter’s case, and
can cause him to feel sadness, joy, and other feelings. It is also
noteworthy that the commandments of love are always expressed through
agapao, i.e. agape is the <q>rule of love</q> (i.e. love that should be).</p>
<p>There is more about agape here:

<p>In relation to Jesus’ words, <q>What (is it) to you?</q>, Peter, as an
emotional person, needed a <q>floodway</q> for his feelings so that he would
not be overwhelmed. We can also say that emotional love for God requires
more obedience and attention to God, and sometimes more restraint is
needed in relation to people.</p>
<p>The same words also teach us not to desire what our neighbour has. I
once wrote some works about this, and it can be understood in different
ways. I would say that Jesus’ way of dealing with possible envy is based
on two key points: <q>you</q> and <q>that</q> (<q>it</q>). He says that there is no
<q>link</q> between <q>you</q> and <q>it</q> (<q>What?</q> emphasises this absence). In
other words, in order not to be envious, you need to deeply understand
and accept this lack of <q>connection</q>.</p>
<p>It is worth saying that the question <q>what?</q> can also have a positive
meaning  &ndash; in addition to denying envy, it can allow us to see the
connection, the commonality and develop them further in a good sense, in
true commanded love.</p>
<p>The Gospel also warns against misunderstanding.</p>
<p>It concludes with the idea of the depth and inexhaustibility of the
work of salvation accomplished by Jesus Christ. It also refutes the idea
that <q>theology has already been fully created</q>. As we can see from the
words of the Gospel, this idea is never correct. The Lord is truly rich
and generous in His mercies and bounties.</p>
