<p>The promise of Jesus to those who leave everything and follow Him
needs to be explained here.</p>
<p>The twelve tribes and thrones clearly refer to the 12 apostles
themselves (Paul may be among them). With regard to the judgement of the
apostles, the place may have different meanings. Almost everywhere, with
the exception of this place, it is spoken of the judgement of God
instead. But we can recall the judicial system in the time of Moses -
Moses could not cope on his own, he was advised by his father-in-law
Jethro (incidentally, not a Jew) to take helpers  &ndash; other wise and
experienced, decent people, and they all judged together, and Moses
himself judged the difficult cases (Exodus XVIII).</p>
<p>God does not need such <q>helpers</q> as the Omnipotent and Omniscient
One, but He wants other beings, including people, to participate in His
actions. Therefore, the apostles are here as the helpers of Moses (who
were thus a prototype), but importantly, this shows that the Church also
has judicial power.</p>
<p>This is the authority not of one apostle, but of all.</p>
<p>Paul also mentions in his letters that: <q>Do you not know that we will
judge the angels?</q>, and these words may also refer to non-apostles.</p>
<p>Jesus said: <q>The word that I speak, it will judge,</q> and this sheds
light on the meaning of all these passages. Jesus’ words, God’s words
will reveal what was right, good, necessary, and what was harmful and
evil.</p>
<p>So the glory of the apostles will be such that it will reveal the
deeds of people and testify in agreement with the apostles themselves
about the people, how they lived.</p>
<p>And the broader promise is comforting: <q>There is no one who…</q>. We
also need to see the context of these words  &ndash; a rich young man has just
refused to follow Jesus like the apostles. And here Peter asks. That is,
there is a contrast  &ndash; a person attached to earthly things and the
apostles who left everything behind (not necessarily literally, for
example, Peter was married and remained so, they could continue to fish
and so on, but the apostles got rid of attachment to everything that
could hinder them on their way to God). In the same way, the rich young
man’s shortcoming was not his wealth, but his attachment to it. His
heart was thus divided, and he was imperfect (in the worst case, he
might even have fallen into double-mindedness).</p>
<p>So, Jesus’ words do not have a literal meaning (for to leave someone
literally does not mean not to be attached to something that does not
allow one to go to God, but it is the latter that is needed  &ndash; to go to
God, to draw closer to Him, to grow spiritually), but they speak of a
determination to go to God, to enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>And since a person really leaves his or her attachment for the sake
of the Lord, then he or she will certainly leave sins and passions in
this regard  &ndash; otherwise he or she could not leave attachment. And those
who love the Lord so much that they are not touched by sins and passions
are truly going (heading for, approaching) the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I would also add that the faithful in the Kingdom of God are a great
happy community, the Church of Heaven and Earth, but even now in the
Church such a determined and sincere faithful person will not remain
alone.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
