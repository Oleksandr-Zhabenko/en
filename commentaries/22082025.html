The preposition 'ek' indicates here from where the Lord will gather the faithful — figuratively speaking, from everywhere, but there may be specification that on Earth.

Here both times in plural, which may indicate cosmos, Universe, may indicate different worlds, may indicate something else, still unknown. In short, prophecy about the faithful being everywhere, where people will be, and where people will be — is absolutely unclear, possibly, farther than the boundaries of the visible Universe now.

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html</a><br>
are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians IV, 13-18) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians IV, 15 — 'εἰς τὴν δόξαν' - 'eis ten doxan' - <q>unto glory; for glory</q>. Here the preposition 'eis' indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 17 — 'εἰς ὑπερβολὴν αἰώνιον βάρος δόξης κατεργάζεται ἡμῖν' - 'eis hyperbolen aionion baros doxes katergazetai hemin' - <q>for exceedingly weightier eternal glory worketh (bringeth; accomplisheth) for us</q>. God in eternity bestows upon the faithful, who have endured tribulations and sufferings for His sake, significantly greater glory, which significantly exceeds all sufferings. The preposition 'eis' here indicates purpose.
</p>
<p>
Paul before this spoke about difficulties, challenges and trials in connection with apostolic work, therefore here he says that they cannot be compared with eternal glory in Christ after the resurrection of the dead.
</p>
<p>
By <q>inner man</q> one can understand primarily the heart of man, as the core of his personality and his life. More about such understanding is at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Adultery-briefly.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Adultery-briefly.html</a>
</p>
<p>
By <q>outer man</q> is meant first of all the totality of various circumstances of life of the apostles, of many faithful. For example, the circumstances of apostolic work do not allow the apostles to become rich (they do not seek this either), but contribute to their growth in Christ and eternal reward in glory.
</p>
<p>

<reading>(Matthew XXIV, 27-33, 42-51) </reading><br>
Matthew XXIV, 27 — 'ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν' - 'apo anatolon' - <q>from the east; from east</q>. The preposition 'apo' indicates here that it is spoken about the lightning <q>leaving</q> the east and becoming visible in light to all in all directions, everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXIV, 29 — 'ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ' - 'ek tou ouranou' - <q>from the heaven; from the sky</q>. The heaven (the sky) here is in singular. Possibly, it is spoken about the visible physical sky, though there are various interpretations.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXIV, 30 — 'ἐν οὐρανῷ' - 'en ourano' - <q>in heaven; in the sky</q>. See above.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXIV, 31 — 'τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων ἀνέμων ἀπ' ἄκρων οὐρανῶν ἕως ἄκρων αὐτῶν' - 'tous eklektous autou ek ton tessaron anemon ap akron ouranon heos akron auton' - <q>His chosen from the four winds from the ends of heavens even unto the ends of them</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here from where the Lord will gather the faithful — figuratively speaking, from everywhere, but there may be specification that on Earth. The preposition 'apo' in its form before the next vowel indicates here that these chosen will leave those ends of heavens. Here both times in plural, which may indicate cosmos, Universe, may indicate different worlds, may indicate something else, still unknown. In short, prophecy about the faithful being everywhere, where people will be, and where people will be — is absolutely unclear, possibly, farther than the boundaries of the visible Universe now.

</p>
<p>
Matthew XXIV, 32 — 'Ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς συκῆς μάθετε τὴν παραβολήν' - 'Apo de tes sykes mathete ten parabolen' - <q>from the fig tree learn the parable (example, comparison)</q>. The preposition 'apo' indicates here that the faithful should in no way be like that fig tree, but should learn from it.
