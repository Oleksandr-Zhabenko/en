Since there are many considerations on the topic of the conflict between the apostles Peter and Paul, I have to say the following.
</p>
<p>
The conflict described in Scripture was not a theological one. All the apostles at that time agreed on theology. Peter was <q>pleasing the people</q>.<br>
The greatest zealot for Old Testament traditions was James, but he personally advocated the peace proposal. Peter followed the tradition before God's revelation in matters of ritual. But in the case of the conflict with Paul, he simply did not act according to faith and reason, but was guided by <q>pastoral considerations</q> for the ones, forgetting the others.
</p>
<p>
See in particular:<br>
Acts X, 9-16; 34-48; XI, 2-18; XV, 1-33; Galatians II, 11-15.
</p>
<p>
In other letters and texts, Paul does not speak against Peter, but against those who forced him to follow Jewish traditions.
</p>
<p>
Peter, apparently, under the influence of Paul's rebuke, reformed.
</p>
<p>
After the Apostolic Council, the apostles did not force anyone to keep the entire Law of Moses. But there are different people in the Church besides the apostles. Just like now, a person who enters a temple can meet not only a bishop or priest, but also parishioners who may say something completely different. The same problem existed in the days of the apostles.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
