<p>(Acts XXIII, 1-11) Acts XXIII, 6 - â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ - â€˜eimiâ€™ - (I) <q>am</q>. Used
for emphasis.</p>
<p>Acts XXIII, 11 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™ - â€˜emouâ€™ - â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>The story of Paulâ€™s judgement by the Jews in Jerusalem. The high
priest breaks the Law, while Paul obeys it, even though it costs the
apostle much.</p>
<p>Paul finds a way to create discord between the unrighteous judges by
exploiting the difference in their views, which he had known since his
youth.</p>
<p>The Lord also praises and strengthens Paul, gives him the promised
wisdom through the Holy Spirit, and reveals that he is to continue to
witness, not only in Jerusalem but also in Rome.</p>
<p>(John XVI, 15-23) John XVI, 15 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±â€™ - â€˜emaâ€™ - â€˜Myâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™ -
â€˜emouâ€™ - â€˜Mineâ€™.</p>
<p>John XVI, 23 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™ - â€˜emeâ€™ - â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>The readings focus on the words of Jesus about the events that
followed, His suffering, death, Resurrection, and appearances to His
disciples. But also in a general perspective - there will be many
examples in the history of the Church quite similar to these events in
terms of the resolution of issues. There is a deep drama in the meaning
of Jesusâ€™ words: the disciples will weep, lament, grieve, but the world
will rejoice in the occasion, thinking that they have defeated Christ.
Instead, Christ will rise from the dead, appear to the disciples, and
their sadness will be transformed into joy of the disciples themselves,
because of Christâ€™s Victory over sin and death. The disciples, however,
in their understanding of Christâ€™s Kingdom as earthly dominion, could
not understand this properly at the time of the speech, remaining with
their own opinions.</p>
<p>Christ again assures them that they can pray in His name. I wrote
about this earlier, see the link:
