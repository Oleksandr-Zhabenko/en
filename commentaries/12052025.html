<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: (John VI, 56-69) 
John VI, 56 — ὁ τρώγων μου τὴν σάρκα καὶ πίνων μου τὸ αἷμα ἐν ἐμοὶ μένει κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ - ho trogon mou ten sarka kai pinon mou to haima en emoi menei kago en auto - &amp;amp;#39;whoever eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood, he remains in Me and I in him. This refers to the perichoresis of Christ and the faithful ones through the consumption of the Eucharist Sacrament. It is Christ Who brings all the components of His words about the Eucharist together, Who imparts eternal blessed life to the faithful through His Body and Blood. He is the Living One, He gives life, He is the Saviour, He received everything from the Father, He unites the faithful with the Trinity, He came down from the heaven, He is the Alpha and Omega, as the Revelation says. That is why the Eucharist is celebrated in memory of Christ. See more, in particular, at the following links:

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(John VI, 56-69) </reading><br>
John VI, 56 — <q>ὁ τρώγων μου τὴν σάρκα καὶ πίνων μου τὸ αἷμα ἐν ἐμοὶ μένει κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ</q> - <q>ho trogon mou ten sarka kai pinon mou to haima en emoi menei kago en auto</q> - &#39;whoever eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood, he remains in Me and I in him<q>. This refers to the perichoresis of Christ and the faithful ones through the consumption of the Eucharist Sacrament. It is Christ Who brings all the components of His words about the Eucharist together, Who imparts eternal blessed life to the faithful through His Body and Blood. He is the Living One, He gives life, He is the Saviour, He received everything from the Father, He unites the faithful with the Trinity, He came down from the heaven, He is the Alpha and Omega, as the Revelation says.

John VI, 58 — ‘οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἄρτος ὁ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ καταβάς’ - ‘houtos estin ho artos ho ex ouranou katabas’ - ‘this is the bread that came down from the heaven’. Again, the Lord returns to the explanation of the </q>bread from the heaven<q>. See more at the following links:<br>

 &#39;εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα&#39; — &#39;eis ton aiona&#39; - &#39;forever&#39;. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 59 — “ἐν συναγωγῇ διδάσκων ἐν Καφαρναούμ</q> - <q>en synagogue didaskon en Kapharnaoum</q> - <q>in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 60 — <q>Πολλοὶ οὖν ἀκούσαντες ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ</q> - <q>Polloi oun akousantes ek ton matheton autou</q> - <q>Many of His disciples who heard then</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates that these are representatives of the disciples, people who generally shared the vision and actions of Christ&#39;s disciples.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 61 — <q>ἐν ἑαυτῷ</q> - <q>en heauto</q> - <q>in Himself</q>. That is, internally as God.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 64 — <q>εἰσὶν ἐξ ὑμῶν τινες οἳ οὐ πιστεύουσιν</q> - <q>eisin ex hymon tines hoi ou pisteuousin</q> - <q>there are some of you who do not believe</q>. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates that it is the representatives of the disciples, the people who are called disciples of Christ. &#39;ἐξ ἀρχῆς&#39; - <q>ex arkhes</q> - <q>from the beginning</q>. A common expression. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel is used instead of the more commonly used in such instances ‘apo’, which indicates the beginning of a new period of time. Here, this special use indicates that the Son of God, as God, knew this before He chose the disciples, i.e. the moment He chose the disciples was not the moment when He <q>came to know</q> it. He knows everything in advance as God.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 65 — <q>ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ δεδομένον αὐτῷ ἐκ τοῦ πατρός</q> - <q>hean me e dedomenon auto ek tou patros</q> - <q>unless it is given to him from the Father</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates that it is God Himself Who is being referred to, not the things of God. That is, it is not a matter of some ‘coincidence’ that God has permitted or favoured, but a direct gift from God, which represents God&#39;s love for people and for creation in general. If a person really receives something good, it really originates from God.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 66 — <q>Ἐκ τούτου οὖν</q> - <q>Ek toutou oun</q> - <q>(because) of that then</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates a reason, not a time: that is, for this reason, that the disciples did not accept the teaching of Christ. &#39;ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω&#39; - <q>apelthon eis ta opiso</q> - <q>they went back</q>. That is, where to, in general - they left Jesus as Teacher, ceased to be the true disciples.
