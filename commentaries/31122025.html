it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews X, 1-18 ) </reading><br>
Hebrews X, 1 — &#39;εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς&#39; - &#39;eis to dienekes&#39; - <q>continually; always; repeatedly throughout significant time</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here enters into an adverbial construction.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 3 — &#39;ἐν αὐταῖς&#39; - &#39;en autais&#39; - <q>in them</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 5 — &#39;εἰς τὸν κόσμον&#39; - &#39;eis ton kosmon&#39; - <q>into the world</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 7 — &#39;ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου&#39; - &#39;en kephalidi bibliou&#39; - <q>in the scroll (roll) of the book</q>. Where. Valuable books then were in the form of scrolls.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 10 — &#39;ἐν ᾧ θελήματι&#39; - &#39;en ho thelemati&#39; - <q>in the will</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 12 — &#39;εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς&#39; - &#39;eis to dienekes&#39; - <q>constantly; always; forever</q>. Here similar to verse 1, but means constancy, and not repeatability. &#39;ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;en dexia tou theou&#39; - <q>at the right hand of God</q>. A common expression, used regarding God the Father, means in the highest glory and honour.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 14 — &#39;εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς&#39; - &#39;eis to dienekes&#39; - <q>forever</q>. Here in the meaning <q>forever</q>, that is after the Sacrifice of Christ the state forever changed.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul in detail compares the Sacrifice of Christ with the Old Testament sacrifices from the priests. He quotes prophecies about Christ from the Old Testament.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul does not speak about the psychology of sacrifices, but only about the ontology (that which is essential). So, from the point of view of psychology, the sinner who had to bring a sacrifice for sin in the Old Testament, felt sorrow through the need to sacrifice their property, and if they loved that animal, or had compassion for it (and so also could be), then also additional pangs of conscience, which strengthened the desire to repent and to improve. Also the appearance of animal sacrifices was to evoke in the priests greater desire not to sin, and that people should not sin, greater zeal in service, and ever greater expectation of the Deliverer, the promised Saviour, the Messiah.
</p>
<p>
But on the level of ontology, on the level of the essential, animal sacrifices truly could not bring cleansing and forgiveness. Instead on this level they were images and prefigurations of the Sacrifice of Christ, a certain likeness of the very sacrificial nature of the Son of God for salvation. Whereas the Sacrifice of Christ is no longer an image, but essential and brings forgiveness and redemption. See more about that at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15072023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15072023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
As the spiritual heaven is higher than the material world (earth), so also the Sacrifice of Christ is more essential than the Old Testament sacrifices, being their fulfilment and accomplishment, completion, why now they do not have that significance which they had once.

Mark VIII, 31 — &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ τῶν γραμματέων&#39; — &#39;hypo ton presbyteron kai ton arkhiereon kai ton grammateon&#39; - <q>by the elders, and the high priests, and the scribes</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the verbs. See also at the links:<br>
