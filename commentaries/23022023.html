<p>Today, the New Testament reading was still being read.</p>

<p><reading>(Jude I, 11-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>The continuation of the apostle Jude touches on the
same topics as the beginning, as well as others. For those topics, see

<p>The name mentions of Old Testament sinners who opposed God can
somewhat confirm the idea that what happened in the Old Testament to the
bodies of sinners happens in the New Testament with their souls.
Consequently, the Old Testament texts are instructive to us.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of the use of images in the epistle indicate that
these people, who are exposed by the apostle Judas, committed also
bodily sins.</p>
<p>Enoch’s prophecy is taken from the apocryphal Old Testament book,
which was also then prevalent among the Jews. The said Enoch was, like
Elijah, taken alive to heaven, there are many thoughts, that he will
return with Elijah again before the Second Coming, although this is a
debatable opinion.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXIII 1-34, 44-56) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the Gospel it was read about suffering,
the death of Jesus Christ on the cross, and related events, omitting
some details. Very deep texts, just small comments for more clarity.</p>
<p>There is a good work on the court of Pontius Pilate at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Power.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Power.html</a></p>
<p>Luke emphasizes that Pontius at least quite consciously considered
Jesus not worthy of death, and if guilty of something incomprehensible
to Him, it is definitely not as much as the criminal Varavva. But Pilate
lacked the resolve to uphold established innocence, so much so that he
agreed to the execution of Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus’ appeal to women shows His love of mankind, as well as the
consciousness that He will resurrect. He again prophesies of the fall of
Jerusalem, also of other events that will be at the approach of the
Second Coming. Jesus restrains the crying of women because of their
unbelief (ignorance) — they wept because they did not know, or did not
believed in His Resurrection, did not see God’s saving action in the
events that took place. Christ did not deny that compassion for Him in
Suffering was good, but only disbelief and ignorance restrained.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful essay on the darkness at the link:

<p>The centurion saw the actions of Jesus and recognized His
righteousness, later, according to Tradition, became a Christian and a
holy martyr named Longinus-centurion.</p>
<p>Joseph of Arimathea was a righteous and rich, secret disciple of
Jesus. One of my beloved saints.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
