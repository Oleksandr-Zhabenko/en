<p><reading>(Galatians II, 11-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Galatians II:14  &ndash; εμπροσθεν  &ndash; emprosthen  &ndash; <q>in
front of, before the face</q>.</p>
<p>Galatians II, 15, 16  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>The story of Paul’s reproach of Peter for situational hypocrisy -
demanding of others what Peter did not fulfil himself. The disciples of
James, the Lord’s brother, like Peter himself, were Jewish Christians
and tried to fulfil the whole Law of Moses as Jews. Peter, for the sake
of preaching to the Gentiles, had to break some of the ceremonial rules
of the Law of Moses, but in front of James’ disciples he tried to show
himself to be a Judeo-Christian like them, observing all the rules,
including the ceremonial ones, which was double-minded and a
manifestation of hypocrisy (here in the sense of trying to show himself
to be something other than he really was, which was misleading and
generally undermined trust).</p>
<p>Paul had the courage to reproach one of the <q>pillars of the church</q>
(as he had just written), and he did the right thing, according to the
will of God.</p>
<p>It must be said that Peter accepted the reproach and corrected
himself. He continued to preach to the Gentiles, no longer trying to
demand that they keep the entire ceremonial law of Moses. Nevertheless,
if we compare him with Paul, the latter was more consistent in this.</p>
<p>Much has been written about verse 16 in the Epistle to the Romans, in
particular in the readings listed at the following links:

<p><reading>(Mark V, 24-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>The story of the healing of a bleeding woman through
faith and touching Jesus’ garment. The healing took place in the midst
of other miracles referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="07092023.html">07092023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The parallel short passage in Matthew was described here:
<br><a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Mark gives more details.</p>
<p>Jesus’ dialogue is understood to mean that He knew as God what was
happening and He Himself healed the woman, but in Mark Jesus’ words
refer to Jesus’ human nature  &ndash; He felt as a human being. It is clear
that human beings do not heal by nature; miracles are not inherent in
human nature. At the same time, as a human being, Jesus knew what was
happening and agreed to it (by virtue of the hypostatic union of the two
natures in the One Person, the One Lord Jesus Christ, the
God-Human).</p>
<p>It is understood that Jesus’ question was asked to reveal the woman’s
faith and to praise her as an example to others.</p>
<p>We also see here an example of how the shrine, through the power of
God, the grace of God, can greatly contribute to healing by faith, and
more generally to the fulfilment of the expected and requested good.</p>
<p>It should also be said that the woman’s ritual uncleanness did not
defile the Lord Jesus, but on the contrary  &ndash; such was her faith and
God’s will to heal the woman.</p>
