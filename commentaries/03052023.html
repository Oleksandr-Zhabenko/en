<p><reading>(Acts VIII, 18-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts VIII:20  &ndash; ‘ενομισας’  &ndash; literally ‘to do
according to the law (custom)’, meaning that he was not just thinking of
getting God’s gift for money, but that was his usual way of thinking -
‘everything can be obtained for money, even God’s gifts’.</p>
<p>Acts VIII, 21  &ndash; literally, <q>the heart is not straight</q> (as opposed to
crooked and twisted), i.e. it is precisely the <q>twisted heart</q> of this
Simon that is being addressed.</p>
<p>Acts VIII, 22  &ndash; literally, <q>if the attention of the mind of your
heart is forgiven</q>  &ndash; that is, the intention in this case is called <q>the
attention (</q>direction”) of the mind of the heart”.</p>
<p>Acts VIII, 24  &ndash; ‘επ’ εμε’  &ndash; (so that nothing of the like happens)
<q>over (to) me</q>.</p>
<p>The story of simony, i.e. the purchase of spiritual gifts and
privileges for money or material values. This is one of the most serious
sins, and the name comes from the name of this Simon. ‘Simony’ is a
resemblance to this Simon who wanted to receive the gifts of the Holy
Spirit for money.</p>
<p>Why is the heart in simony not straight (right)? Because it implies
<q>taking God (God’s grace) for hostage</q> to material circumstances and
things  &ndash; specifically, money. Such a conception of God simply puts Him
on a par with entirely material things, and is therefore seriously wrong
and blasphemous.</p>

<p><reading>(John VI, 35-39) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VI, 35  &ndash; ‘προς εμε’  &ndash; ‘pros eme’  &ndash; ‘to Me’,
‘εις εμε’  &ndash; ‘eis eme’  &ndash; ‘in Me’.</p>
<p>John VI, 37  &ndash; ‘προς εμε’ and ‘προς με’  &ndash; ‘to Me’.</p>
<p>John VI, 38  &ndash; ‘το θελημα το εμον’  &ndash; ‘My will’.</p>

<p>Christ speaks of His mission on land at the time of His First Coming.
Briefly the sense of Christianity as such.</p>
<p>A person who <q>comes to Christ</q> is a person who is permanently moving,
making certain efforts, towards Christ. That is, it is never an
occasional process.</p>
<p>That is, if a person consciously tries and cares to get closer to
Jesus Christ, He will not hinder him or her, will help him or her in
this and will not shun or expel him or her from Him. The Lord is always
waiting for our genuineness and ourselves.</p>
<p>If one wants to be like Christ in His love, the main reason that can
prevent this is also named here: the search for one’s own will
(<q>willfulness</q>). I wrote a little about this in the post on Jesus as the
Righteous Judge:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="27042023.html">27042023.html</a></p>
<p>In three words, it can be said that Jesus saves people.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
