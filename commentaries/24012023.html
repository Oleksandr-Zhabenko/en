<p><reading>(Mark XI, 11-23) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the regular Gospel, we read about the barren fig tree, about the expulsion of merchants from the temple, and teachings about faith. Commented nicely on faith on January 10, 2023 in a wall post (see also:</p>

<p>).</p>

<p><reading>(James III, 1-10) </reading>
</p>

<p>A passage was read from the regular Apostle where Jacob speaks about language, about the tongue as a part of the body, about its meaning. Complex and intense place, only small comments.</p>
<p><q>teachers</q>  &ndash; in view of the following, specific <q>definition of the apostle Jacob (James)</q>: <q>a teacher is a person who allows you to master information flows.</q></p>
<p>Humans have learned to master the forces of nature, to tame animals, etc., but none of the people can make it so that all people can similarly conveniently master the sphere of information, so that</p>
<p>everyone could always speak the truth, so that everyone would know the truth (in any field and realm), so that everyone would not sin in words and thoughts. And the person who succeeds in this, at least in some part, is a teacher, that person is called perfect in Jacob (James).</p>
<p>There is a nice essay on words and their meaning in relation to other scriptures on August 6, 2022 on my page. I quote</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew 12:35-36) </reading>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><q>Treasury</q> (literally) originally a building where valuables are stored, alike a modern jewelry warehouse, perhaps a bank or something similar. A person sins with words, because he / she <q>brings out</q> verbally his / her <q>bad treasures</q>, and vice versa  &ndash; he / she speaks well, bringing out <q>good treasures</q>. Treasures can be understood not in the way that they are really valuable, but in the way that a person has an attachment, a certain close connection with them, as if it were a treasure, a valuable thing. One can be attached to evil as if to a treasure, and it is so when a person sins with words. You can also see how words should be treated: they are like jewelry, certain jewelry that can be both good and bad (for example, jewelry that is cruel, aggressive, threatening, false, etc.). When a person speaks, he / she gives listeners (readers) such decorations.</p>
<p>In order to overcome the sin of tongue, one must cleanse the heart of evil, which I wrote more about in the work <q>About adultery. Full version</q>.</p>
<p><q>Empty</q> means literally <q>inactive, inactive, lazy</q> (in Slavic <q>Ð¿Ñ€Ð°Ð·Ð´Ð½Ð¾Ðµ</q>), which is also <q>useless</q>. That is, a word that does not have a purpose, does not perform any action, <q>just a word</q>, <q>so be it</q>. As I said before, it is impossible to be neutral about Christ, about good  &ndash; a person is always either for or against, therefore <q>empty</q> words are not really <q>empty</q> or <q>neutral</q> in any way.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
