<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XVI, 4-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XVI, 4  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’ -
(with) ‘me’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XVI, 12  &ndash; ‘ευκαιρηση’  &ndash; ‘eukairese’  &ndash; ‘will have a good
opportunity, a good time, leisure time’.</p>
<p>In general, the reading is about the plans of Paul and his close
co-workers to visit the Corinthians. From the point of view of faith, it
is an instructive text that it is reasonable to take into account
various circumstances, including time and occasion.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXI, 28-32) </reading>
</p>
<p>The parable of the two sons. The sons refer to
different people who have two different attitudes to God’s will, the
will of the Father.</p>
<p>The question <q>Who fulfilled it?</q> refers to the final result, since it
was the decisive one. In the parable, the sons’ agreement/disagreement
is connected with the so-called self-identification of a person  &ndash; how a
person relates to God and how important this is to him or her. Consent
means that a person considers themselves to be a believer and a devout
person, to a certain extent it matters to them, they perceive themselves
as such. Disagreement, on the contrary, means that a person does not
want to associate themselves with God, at least at some stage of their
life, i.e. they are moving away from God and towards sin or directly
into sin.</p>
<p>Instead, here we see the importance of repentance. Many sinful people
who had fallen away from God and did not consider themselves righteous
and devout were converted by John the Baptist’s preaching of repentance,
but those who considered themselves devout and righteous did not want to
do so, because their own self-esteem prevented them from doing so.
Instead, they received a second call to repentance through seeing the
conversion of obviously sinful people, but they did not want to do that
themselves because they did not want to see their own sins. And so, in
the end, what would move them to repentance? And if it is God’s will
that they repent, because everyone is a sinner, then they did not fulfil
God’s will.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that the parable does not imply that it is
better to be a sinful person first in order to be saved. Yes, in the
parable, sinful people repented. But this required the sermon of John
the Baptist (a unique case in history, but more generally, it required a
significant impetus to repentance). What if a person does not feel such
a push? What if sin blocks their vision altogether? Then his condition
is even worse than that of the one who agreed but did not go.</p>
<p>That is why the parable teaches repentance first and foremost,
teaches us to be open to conversion and repentance (not to look for any
special nudges), and also humility  &ndash; a true vision of our condition and
readiness to correct it. In this way, the parable is similar to another
place in the Gospel, which was discussed here:
