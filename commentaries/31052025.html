The first preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that sleep is not the real reason for his exhaustion, but rather fatigue from listening or inattention, a complete lack of interest, which leads to fatigue and monotonous perception, which leads to relaxation. The second preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that when he fell, he completely left the third floor, falling without safety equipment to the ground. Acts XX, 10 — ‘ἡ γὰρ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστιν’ - ‘he gar psykhe autou en auto estin’ - his soul is in him. Where.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
