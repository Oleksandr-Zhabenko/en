<p><reading>(Acts VIII, 26-39) </reading>
</p>
<p>For more information on the quote from the prophet
Isaiah (Isaiah LIII, 7-8), see the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="12042023.html">12042023.html</a></p>
<p>The story of the subsequent preaching of one of the first 7 deacons,
Saint Philip, to a high Ethiopian nobleman who knew the Old Testament
and believed in the One God.</p>
<p>We can note both the humility of the nobleman and his openness to
accepting the truth.</p>
<p>At the same time, Philipâ€™s actions are described as being directly
guided by the Holy Spirit and God (including through an angel). <q>The
Spirit of the Lord took him away</q> is a similar description of the
prophet Elijah, which shows that the apostles had the gift of the Holy
Spirit, just like the honoured prophets of the Old Testament. But unlike
the latter, they had to give it to the other people, which means that
they had a greater fullness of grace. Similarly, the sacraments of
salvation in the New Testament are something that did not exist in the
Old Testament.</p>
<p>And while the meaning of the Old Testament ministry of the prophets
was mainly about preparation, here Philip shares the joy of the coming
of the Saviour and the fulfilment of all those prophecies about Him.</p>

<p><reading>(John VI, 40-44) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s and the previous
several readings.
<br><a class="link2" href="03052023.html">03052023.html</a></p>
<p>John VI, 40  &ndash; <q>and I will raise him up at the last day</q>  &ndash; all those
who are dead at the time of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will be
raised by Him, but here these words mean not just resurrection and
participation in it, but also spiritual renewal and likeness to the Son
of God, similar to the way He resurrected. In other words, in the
language of the same Gospel, it will be a <q>resurrection of life</q>, not a
<q>resurrection of judgement</q>. That is, such a person will be resurrected
to an eternal blissful life with Christ in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The difficult question is whether all such people will be dead at the
time of Jesusâ€™ return. In some places, the Lord says that there may
hardly be believers who are truly deeply faithful before His return. At
the same time, He also says that there will be believers at His return.
Given these last words, we must assume that most of the believers Jesus
mentions in these words will be dead at that time, and He will resurrect
them. Attempts to clarify the estimation in the light of Godâ€™s will will
not succeed until the Lord Himself comes and reveals everything.</p>
<p>This also denies a sudden increase in the number of deeply faithful
people before Jesusâ€™ return  &ndash; no, there will be no such sudden
<q>explosive</q> increase in their number (mass deep conversion).</p>
<p>Christ goes on to speak about the misunderstanding of His words that
arose among the people. Most people did not know how Jesus was born and
that He was the Son of God. Only those to whom the Father had revealed
it knew.</p>
<p>Why is this so? Why does Christ not tell the story of His birth
here?</p>
<p>This is a difficult question.</p>
<p>But one might think that if a person does not see the Divinity in
Jesus, then the story of the Christmas will seem like <q>little evidence</q>
for that person  &ndash; he or she did not see these events, and even the
prophecies that came true will not be decisive for him or her, because
he or she needs to see them fulfilled in Jesus. In other words, most
people see Jesus as Lord not through the story of His Birth, but
primarily through His preaching, miracles, Passion, Death and
Resurrection. That is why the Lord is not telling them the story of the
Christmas, which confirms His words, but is speaking of the Fatherâ€™s
revelation about the Son. See also:
<br><a class="link2" href="28042023.html">28042023.html</a></p>
<p>It must be said that if a person cognises the Son of God with love,
then he or she becomes like the Father, Who knows and loves the Son, Who
sent Him into the world. A person can accept the Son if he or she loves
Him like the Father, and accepts Godâ€™s intention for the salvation of
people and so on. This means that he or she is like the Father in this,
and this is only possible if the Father gives it to him or her.</p>
<p>Therefore, one can come to Jesus only if the Father brings him or
her.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
