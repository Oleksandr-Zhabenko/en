<p>(Acts II, 14-21) About the Descent of the Holy Spirit itself will be
read on the corresponding holiday - Pentecost, and now we are reading
about Peterâ€™s sermon after that - more precisely, the beginning of
it.</p>
<p>I note that the Lord is not afraid to reveal Himself in such a way
that someone may not understand, He does not fully follow the those whom
He addresses, He does not make the main goal to please them, but He
reveals what is important. In human language, he acts boldly, but
thoughtfully, balanced (if we compare God with a person, then one could
say this about such actions of a person).</p>
<p>The prophecy of Joel (Joel III, 1-5 (or II, 28-32)) is quoted almost
verbatim. In the verse of Acts II, 20, <q>glorious</q> is used (<q>manifested</q>,
the root <q>epiphane</q>, that is, a parallel with the Epiphany, which we
celebrate on January 6 (19), while in the Hebrew text of Joel there is
<q>fearful</q>, or <q>one who causes reverence.</q></p>
<p>Glory in the Biblical sense strongly influences others, the very
ability to strongly influence others is a component of glory in the
Biblical sense. See more about that in the article at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Krasa-3.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Krasa-3.html</a><br></p>
<p>Regarding the content of the prophecy, all people are called to the
Kingdom of God. Earlier, in the times of the Old Testament, God revealed
Himself mainly to one nation, but now to all. Previously, ordinary
people could try to approach God on a personal level mainly through
prayer, and in Christ there are many ways. That is why Peter quotes this
prophecy.</p>
<p>(Luke XXIV, 12-35) Emmaus - Greek Î•Î¼Î¼Î±Î¿Ï…Ï‚ - a village about 60 stadia
(11.5 km) west of Jerusalem, translates as <q>hot springs</q>.</p>
<p>In addition to Cleopas, the author of the book himself, the apostle
and evangelist Luke, my beloved saint, who, out of modesty, does not
name himself, is considered another saint (in the Orthodox tradition)
here by name.</p>
<p>Jesus, apparently, appeared to Peter after traveling with the
disciples to Emmaus. While they were quickly returning back on foot, He
much quicker appeared to Peter, and Peter had time to tell the others,
and in the evening they were all together, where the Risen Christ
appeared to them again.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
