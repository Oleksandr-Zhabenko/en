it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
As the Great Lent is approaching, the readings from the New Testament are replaced with readings from the Old Testament, in order to urge people more towards repentance.
</p>
<p>
As it is spoken of several Ancient Greek (Koine) prepositions, the Old Testament readings will continue to be commented upon, examining the first complete translation into Ancient Greek — the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
Roman Catholics today have the beginning of Great Lent, Ash Wednesday. And the reading from the Old Testament is also from the book of the prophet Joel, somewhat shorter than the one used by Orthodox and Greek Catholics at the 6th Hour.

At the 6th Hour:<br>
<reading>(Joel II, 12-26) </reading><br>
Joel II, 12 — 'ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας' &mdash; 'ex holes tes kadrias' - <q>from the whole heart</q>. The preposition 'ek' in its form before the following vowel indicates that this must be sincere. See more at the links:<br>

'ἐν νηστείᾳ καὶ ἐν κλαυθμῷ καὶ ἐν κοπετῷ' — 'en nesteia kai en klauthmo kai en kopeto' &mdash; <q>in fasting, in weeping and in wailing; with fasting, weeping and wailing</q>. Both translation variants are possible.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 13 — literally the ending of the verse in the Hebrew original means <q>restrains Himself, calms Himself, through humility, meekness, gentleness, compassion and the like</q>, and not that the Lord <q>repents of evil</q>, as may appear in an unfortunate translation. The very verb derives from the notion of <q>to sigh</q>, that is, to express sorrow and compassion. The Lord is grieved by the sins and falls of people, He is not gladdened by their suffering and destruction, He is truly Merciful and Long-suffering, truly Good.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 15 — 'ἐν Σιών' &mdash; 'en Sion' - <q>in Sion</q>. In meaning — <q>on Sion</q>.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 16 — 'ἐκ τοῦ κοιτῶνος' &mdash; 'ek tou koitonos' - <q>from the bedchamber; from the chambers</q>. 'ἐκ τοῦ παστοῦ' - 'ek tou pastou' - <q>from the bride's chamber; from the bower</q>. In both cases the preposition 'ek' indicates emergence from somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 17, 19 — 'εἰς ὄνειδος' &mdash; 'eis oneidos' - <q>for reproach; for shame; for disgrace; unto reproach; unto shame; unto disgrace</q>. That is, <q>whereto</q> or <q>for what purpose</q>. 'ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι(ν)' - 'en tois ethnesi(n)' - <q>among the nations; among the Gentiles</q>. Both translation variants are possible, mutually complementing one another.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 20 — 'ἀπὸ βορρᾶ' &mdash; 'apo borra' - <q>from the north</q>. 'ἀφ' ὑμῶν' - 'aph hymon' - <q>from you</q>. The preposition 'apo' indicates what land <q>the one from the north</q> has left, and further — that the Lord will deliver fully from him. 'εἰς γῆν ἄνυδρον' - 'eis gen anydron' - <q>into a waterless land</q>. 'εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν πρώτην' - 'eis ten thalassan ten proten' - <q>unto the first sea</q>. That is, <q>whereto</q> the Lord will direct him. 'εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ἐσχάτην' - 'eis ten thalassan ten eskhaten' - <q>unto the last sea</q>. Analogously to the previous.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 23 — 'τὰ βρώματα εἰς δικαιοσύνην' &mdash; 'ta bromata eis dikaiosynen' - <q>food for righteousness</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates the purpose of the action. Food does not make a person righteous, but here it is emphasised that the Lord will satisfy His faithful in such a way that they will lack nothing and they will be righteous.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 25 — 'ἐξαπέστειλα εἰς ὑμᾶς' &mdash; 'exapesteila eis hymas' - <q>sent unto (upon) you</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates the direction of movement.
</p>
<p>
Joel II, 26 — 'εἰς θαυμάσια' &mdash; 'eis thaumasia' - <q>for wonders; for marvellous deeds</q>. That is, to show them and manifest them to His faithful. 'εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα' - 'eis ton aiona' - <q>for ever</q>. A common expression.
</p>

<p>
So today there were no New Testament readings, yet there was a reading from the book of the prophet Joel, one of the 12 minor prophets. The prophet calls to fasting, reminding the Israelites of God's mercy. In the times of the prophet Joel the word of the Gospel had not yet been proclaimed, and therefore the Israelites fasted often in sorrow. Fasting in the proper sense was a time of spiritual concentration, for the sake of renewal, of the improvement of one's relationship with God, for the sake of purification, a time of preparation. Fasting was a kind of <q>impulse</q>, a <q>push</q> towards the renewal of one's relationship with God. In due course the Pharisees began to perceive fasting in quite a different way, for which they were exposed by Christ. And so Joel calls precisely to that inner, heartfelt <q>impulse</q>.
</p>
<p>
The second thing Joel speaks of is that the Lord, through His actions, will favour the successful fulfilment of His will and will give blessing.
</p>
<p>
I shall also dwell on one detail. On 30 September 2022 it was written about the trumpet and the voice, about music in view of the Gospel words.<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02CaRFnPBsxYCNTdetXckeiAJZkHqeRTp729HSuDwaGo849NdY3TdZZqHfPCitZYGBl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/3050857628546162/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/3050857628546162/</a>
</p>
<p>
Joel speaks of the trumpet in the context of strong weeping, even wailing. Recalling what was written in that publication, I think that in the words <q>sound not a trumpet before thee</q> — <q>trumpeting</q> with respect to singing means an insufficiently controlled sound, resonance, voice. <q>Before thee</q> — the outrunning of oneself, and by <q>oneself</q> is meant not only good control of the voice and sound, but also expressiveness, the ability to convey and <q>to be oneself in sound</q>, which are expressed in the voice. Perhaps it is fitting to strive to achieve that the voice might be clearly associated with oneself (<q>I</q>). I think that to achieve this in truth, in depth, is possible in connection with the whole of life, that is, only as an integral person. And the Lord desires, amongst all else, that we be integral in goodness.
</p>
<p>
My attention was also drawn to Joel I, 12 by its list of trees. Google Gemini Pro 3 explained this passage well, as well as the whole book of the prophet Joel, and therefore I propose to look at the valuable commentaries at the link (in Ukrainian):<br>
