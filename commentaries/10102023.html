<p><reading>(Philippians I, 8-14) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s reading, which
refered to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="09102023.html">09102023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Philippians I, 10  &ndash; ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; ‘day’.</p>
<p>Philippians I, 12  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘me’ ((to) me, (with) me).</p>
<p>Philippians I, 14  &ndash; ‘περισσοτερως τολμαν αφοβως’  &ndash; ‘perissoteros
tolman aphobos’  &ndash; ‘excessively (extremely, exceedingly) boldly
(courageously and) fearlessly’. These words indicate several things: 1)
Paul did not expect the believers to be so inspired to preach because of
his imprisonment for Christ; 2) Paul could have thought of a more
moderate way of preaching to the believers, but they showed zeal and
daring.</p>
<p>We can say from the whole description (today and hereafter) that in
one word (or two): the sermon was <q>fervent, passionate</q>.</p>
<p>The example of Paul’s own boldness and courage as an apostle inspired
others to do the same, especially the situation of Paul’s imprisonment.
What he writes about. There have been many such cases in the history of
the Church, in particular, such references are often made when
describing the suffering of the saint martyrs for Christ.</p>
<p>There is also an important lesson here for everyone  &ndash; we need to
preach with faith, also boldly, but also have wisdom, which Paul speaks
about implicitly  &ndash; we need to show reason in everything.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VIII, 1-3) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke VIII, 2  &ndash; ‘πνευματων πονηρων και ασθενειων’ -
‘pneumaton poneron kai astheneion’  &ndash; ‘evil spirits (bad) and diseases
(sicknesses)’.</p>
<p>The reading tells us that women served Jesus, accompanied Him and the
apostles and helped them with their money (property). In particular,
three women are mentioned by name, all of whom later became
myrrh-bearing women, including my beloved saint woman, the Co-Apostolic
Mary Magdalene. There have been attempts to understand under this name
the forgiven woman-sinner at the end of the previous chapter, but there
is no real evidence for this, but there are weighty objections. In
particular, there is no hint of unclean spirits in the forgiveness of
the repentant sinner (and if there were, the Lord would have delivered
the woman from them along with such an instructive example of
forgiveness and love, and it would also be strange if the spirits
continued to remain in the woman after Jesus’ forgiveness). It would
also be strange if a wealthy woman (Mary Magdalene was, at least wealthy
enough to be able to help a community of men for a long time, such as
the community of Jesus and His apostles) was both possessed and a known
sinner (this is a weak argument, but it is a very real one, because in
those days it would have been difficult for a woman who was possessed
and a publicly known sinner to be really wealthy among the Jews, or at
least her possession and public sinfulness would have made it very
difficult for her to be really wealthy without being connected to a
ruler). Given the latter consideration, it is quite possible that the
seven demons did not manifest themselves too noticeably and explicitly,
so that the woman suffered from them mainly internally, but this was not
very evident externally.</p>
<p>In general, these women (and those who are not named) later became
myrrh-bearers. Among them are two of my favourite saints, Martha and
Mary, the sisters of Lazarus.</p>
<p>I also note that many people point out that the women did not oppose
Jesus. That is, the Incarnate Son of God was worthy in the eyes of all
women of his time.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
