<p><reading>(Romans X, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans X, 1  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒ∑œÇ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòemes‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòmy‚Äô (heart).</p>
<p>Romans X, 8  &ndash; ‚ÄòœÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòrhema‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòthe word, or rather the content,
the essence of the matter in question, what is communicated‚Äô.</p>
<p>I have written before, and I will quote here:</p>
<p><q>It is necessary to dwell at least on the verses of Romans X, 9-10,
which are especially often misunderstood by various Christians, citing
them to justify the image of their own godliness (as the apostle
prophetically warns at the beginning of the chapter). The key is to
understand</q>faith of the heart‚Äù and <q>confession with the mouth</q>. <q>Faith
of the heart</q> here is synonymous with righteousness, and thus with the
Gospel purity of the (whole) heart, and <q>mouth</q> is not only the mouth,
but everything that manifests outwardly in a person‚Äôs life. This passage
does not have the sense of <q>sufficiency only</q> of a narrow understanding
of the heart and lips, it does not allow what all other Scriptures do
not also allow, but uses <q>key concepts</q> to emphasise accessibility and
expressive imagery  &ndash; all people can be saved, <q>Jewish</q> righteousness is
not fundamentally different from <q>Hellenic</q> or <q>Scythian</q> righteousness,
because all people are alike, and righteousness is a gift of God to all
people in Christ.‚Äù</p>

<p><reading>(end of quote) </reading>
</p>

<p>In other words, Paul is not in any way reducing or <q>cutting down</q>
what is said in Scripture, but emphasising what is involved (that faith
is concerned with the heart and confession with the mouth in the
broadest sense), that a combination of faith and confession of faith,
genuineness and righteousness, holistic wholeness and openness is
required.</p>
<p>One could say: <q>If you are genuine in your righteousness to the
deepest parts of your soul, and show your true sincerity in goodness, in
deeds, in words, you will be saved.</q> There is another way to put it: <q>If
you have wholeness in Christ, being righteous both outwardly and
inwardly, and you show this wholeness by being open to people and their
salvation, showing apostolic love and the gospel of Christ, you will be
saved.</q></p>
<p>Examples like this can be continued, and they convey the same meaning
in slightly different expressions and slightly more complex and modern
phrases.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VIII, 28  &ndash; IX, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew IX, 1  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒ≤Œ±œÇ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòembas‚Äô -
<q>having entered, having descended</q> (into, on) (a boat).</p>
<p>The miracle of the exorcism of demons from the Gadara
demon-possessed. This is a well-known story, but I will focus on the
fact that the demons recognised Who Jesus is. This can be understood in
the sense that they knew Who He is (the Lord revealed it to them), or
that they guessed (the Lord did not reveal it to them), or even tried to
deceive the listeners by pretending to know (although this is generally
unlikely). The conclusion from this is that we should not trust evil
spirits, even if they may sometimes tell the truth.</p>
<p>Many people also point out that the Lord allowed demons to enter the
herd of pigs, which means that demons cannot harm even animals (and even
more so humans) without God‚Äôs permission.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that God allows the herd to drown. But what is
important here is that people come to know who He is in this way, and
another Gospel describes that the preaching of a healed men from demons
later created a good ground for the later acceptance of Jesus.</p>
<p>There is also the question of whether it was one demon-possessed man
or two  &ndash; more likely that there were two, just one of the evangelists
recorded the story from the mouth of a witness who described the event
in a simplified way (this often happens in witness stories).</p>

Luke X, 38-42; XI, 27-28) See here:
