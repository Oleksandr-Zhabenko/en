<p><reading>(Acts XVII, 1-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading about Paul’s preaching in Europe
continues. Despite the different attitudes of his hearers and other
people, Paul works hard, continues his preaching, and it is worth noting
the help he and his co-workers receive from the faithful.</p>

<p><reading>(John XI, 47-57) </reading>
</p>
<p>The events following the resurrection of the
righteous Lazarus (which was commemorated on Lazarus’ Sabbath on the eve
of the Lord’s Entry into Jerusalem). See more about this here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="08042023.html">08042023.html</a></p>
<p>John XI, 51, 52  &ndash; ‘ἤμελλεν’  &ndash; ‘emellen’  &ndash; ‘was close to’  &ndash; from
‘μελλω’  &ndash; ‘mello’  &ndash; ‘to intend, to be close to’. <q>For the people</q> -
‘υπερ’  &ndash; ‘(h)yper’  &ndash; which with the genitive case has many meanings,
including reasons (<q>for the people, or rather their salvation</q>),
<q>(over)</q>. See more about the word here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Hyper.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Hyper.html</a></p>
<p>John XI, 54  &ndash; ‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘freedom, openness,
confidence, boldness, all-outspokenness, frankness’. ‘εμεινεν’ -
‘emeinen’  &ndash; (He) <q>remained</q>  &ndash; from ‘μενω’  &ndash; ‘meno’  &ndash; ‘to stay, to abide,
to remain’.</p>
<p>The reading tells of a plot by the Pharisees, priests and elders of
the Jewish people to capture and kill Jesus. It is clear that they all
saw Jesus as a political figure who was planning to seize political
power in Israel, even though Jesus had shown in many ways that this was
not the case.</p>
<p>The words of the high priest Caiaphas were a prophecy, but we should
not think that this somehow exalts him. The fact is that God foresaw the
evil intentions of their hearts and wanted to save the people, and
Caiaphas was not actually a prophet at all, but knowing his evil will,
God also showed a sign through him (through His omniscience) in this
way. Nevertheless, it is shown that the high priest, by reason of his
occupation and importance, thought of the people, so his words were not
only purely personal thoughts, but also concerned (though against his
wishes) God’s children.</p>
<p>Jesus, as God, knew what was happening, so He acted in such a way
that the timing was right.</p>
<p>To Saint Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra of Lycia, Wonderworker:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews XIII, 17-21)</reading><br>
 Hebrews XIII, 17  &ndash; ‘υπερ’  &ndash; ‘(h)yper’  &ndash; ‘above, for
a reason, above’. See the above with the reference cited there.</p>
<p>Hebrews XIII, 19  &ndash; ‘παρακαλω’  &ndash; ‘parakalo’  &ndash; ‘I beg’ (the word is
polysemous, here it is most likely ‘I beg’ (you)).</p>
<p>The letter to the Hebrews ends with solemn praise and thanksgiving to
God.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Saint Nicholas can also address the faithful with
these words, although he no longer needs our prayers, but we need to
honour him, and these words also glorify his archpastoral ministry
indirectly.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VI, 17-23) </reading><br>
The reading from Luke’s Sermon on the Mount is a
frequently read one. Unlike the parallel place in Matthew, it briefly
presents the Beatitudes, focuses on social life, on the life of
communities, and also contains Jesus Christ’s compassion for those who
live contrary to the Beatitudes (yes, it is compassion, sadness for
them).</p>
<p>St Nicholas fulfilled these precepts to a great extent in his life,
which is why this place is read, and it is also mentioned in the prayers
of praise in honour of the saint, in particular the troparion.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
