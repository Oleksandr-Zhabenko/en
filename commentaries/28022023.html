<p>Readings of the Old Testament today are continued by those of
yesterday. Therefore, today’s thoughts continue yesterday’s by the
following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="27022023.html">27022023.html</a></p>

<p><reading>(Isaiah I, 19  &ndash; II, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>Isaiah’s prophecies are multifaceted and
multi-meaningful. For example, the judgment of God points both to the
troubles that Israel experienced historically, and to the First Coming
of Christ, and to the Second Coming of Christ, and to God’s Providence
always, and … but everywhere not in the same sense.</p>
<p>Regarding the First Coming, it points to the power of the Lord, to
grace and the Gospel, which destroys sin, as fire destroys ordinary
things, destroys the very foundation  &ndash; so the Lord came to <q>destroy the
kingdom of death</q>, <q>to wipe out the head of the serpent</q>, etc. Indeed,
the Lord gave everything necessary for a completely successful and
victorious fight against sins and prejudices, <q>lit the fire</q> (which,
remember, He really wanted to light).</p>
<p>In regard to the Second Coming, the fire indicates the glory of God,
with which everything will be filled. And how they understand, for the
saved, it will be like a light, to which they are partakers and
accomplices, as a source of all good, and for those who will perish  &ndash; as
a fire and that which will reveal their eternal existence.</p>
<p>Regarding God’s Providence, the fire indicates that the grace of God
constantly gives people the power to overcome sins and cleanses, if only
people would combine with it in this.</p>
<p>In relation to historical events, departure from God’s will leads to
decay. More about that is available at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/2796433527321908/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/2796433527321908/</a></p>
<p>In view of such multiplicity and multifacetedness (and in fact I have
only very briefly pointed out certain moments of everything) it is even
difficult to say that the prophecy was fulfilled then, because it
reveals what always happens and what happened, and what will happen.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis I, 14-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>I will draw attention to the fact that God creates
the visible (Universe) world with the participation of creation itself
(when the latter one exists). There is more about it in the good works
at the links:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Proof.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Proof.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="https://sites.google.com/view/rozdumy23/home/isnuvanna-piznaemo-virou">https://sites.google.com/view/rozdumy23/home/isnuvanna-piznaemo-virou</a></p>
<p>God creates the world <q>according to their kinds</q> — that is,
<q>grouping</q> and <q>distinction</q> take place. There is an opinion that this
is an argument in favor of the so-called theory of microevolution and
the denial of macroevolution  &ndash; evolution occurs within species, but not
between species (one biological species does not evolve into others),
and this theory has many essential arguments. In general, this is one of
the issues that we do not understand as well as we would like, and which
is therefore of interest.</p>
<p>The <q>days</q> of creation, as we know, are not our days, but are certain
<q>periods of time</q> (and in my opinion, the very vagueness of the word
<q>iom</q>, which is translated as <q>day</q> points to … Einstein’s theory of
relativity).</p>
<p>Interesting data on modern scientific views on the topic of the
beginning of the universe can be found in the English-language video at
the link:

<p>Regarding some other issues, I will write (God grant me!)
tomorrow.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs I, 20-33) </reading>
</p>
<p>The key verse to understand is Proverbs I, 31.
Overall a very deep text, about one of its aspects there is a good essay
at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a></p>
<p>In general, it must be said that <q>wisdom</q> is also a multi-meaningful
and multi-faceted image. I will dwell only on what is said about
laughter. I think it is possible to reason that laughter is a reaction
to the comic, and the latter arises as a certain discrepancy, for
example, according to the classical definition, between form and
content. <q>Laughter</q> figuratively (this is an anthropomorphism) depicts
the lack of connection  &ndash; between appeal and reaction  &ndash; people will
appeal to wisdom, but will not find it. But they rejected it  &ndash; that’s
why they can’t find it, because they don’t look for it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord reveals, as a warning, and an incentive to seek
wisdom, and it leads to God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
