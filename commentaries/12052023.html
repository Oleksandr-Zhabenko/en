<p>(Acts x, 44 - xi, 10) Acts x, 44 - literally the Holy Spirit <q>seized,
embraced</q>.</p>
<p>Acts X, 47 - not quite clear, literally something more like: <q>Can it
be that water could restrain (prevent) these who have received the Holy
Spirit as we have?</q> (which was <q>poured out abundantly</q> on the hearers).
That is, the meaning of the question is that the Gentiles received the
gift of the Holy Spirit before baptism, and this gift is much greater
than the water in the Sacrament, so it is not an obstacle. That is, the
main action has taken place, and now the less important one will not
have any obstacles. It should be added that in ordinary affairs, the
fact that the larger or more important part of the matter has been
accomplished does not mean that the smaller or less important part will
be accomplished as well. But here we are talking about God - He has
accomplished the more important part, and He knew that the less
important part would be accomplished.</p>
<p>Acts XI, 5 - ‘εμου’ - ‘emou’ - (where) ‘I’.</p>
<p>Peter’s testimony and the situation itself can also be better
understood from a good work:
<br><a class="link2" href="08052023.html">08052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>(John VIII, 21-30) John VIII, 23, 24, 28 - ‘ειμι’ - ‘eimi’ - (I)
‘am’. It is used only for emphasis.</p>
<p>John VIII, 28 - ‘εμαυτου’ - ‘emautou’ - ‘Myself’.</p>
<p>John VIII, 29 - ‘εμου’ - ‘emou’ - (with) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>It would seem that there is nothing surprising in the fact that
people misunderstood Jesus, because they are not God, but human beings.
But it was precisely this limited understanding that showed their
distance from God, Who was actually revealing Himself to them. If the
Lord had not given people many gifts, such as the gift of conscience,
Revelation, the Law, and so on, it would indeed be expected that they
would not understand Jesus. But since the Lord gave them so many things,
and yet they did not understand Jesus, this was the evidence of their
distance from God.</p>
<p>John VIII, 24 - <q>I am</q> - Jesus emphasises that He Is, i.e. He
emphasises His personal significance along with the fact that He exists
(this is evidence that He is God). This can be seen better in the
beautiful essay at the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html ">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html
</a><br> See the explanation of John V, 26.</p>
<p>John VIII, 25 is a difficult passage to translate, because Jesus
answers the people’s questions with the accusative case (questions:
whom? what?), not the nominative case (questions: who? what?). The most
common translation is <q>‘From the beginning I am (the Substantial One)’
or ‘the Beginning’ (the latter is grammatically inappropriate). One
could also try to translate</q>I also tell you about the beginning,” where
the case is accusative, but then Jesus evades a direct answer.</p>
<p>In any case, it is a direct witness to the fact that the Son of God
is with the Father.</p>
<p>Also today we had a reading (from the Epistle to the Galatians and
the Gospel of Luke) in honour of St Amphilochius of Pochayiv, one of the
most revered Ukrainian Orthodox saints, almost our contemporary.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
