it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians X, 5-12) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians X, 5 — 'ἐν τοῖς πλείοσιν αὐτῶν' - 'en tois pleiosin auton' - <q>in many of them; with many of them</q>. Both variants of translation with the corresponding verb are correct. 'κατεστρώθησαν' - 'katestrothesan' - <q>scattered, dispersed on the ground</q>. 'ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ' - 'en te eremo' - <q>in the wilderness</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 6, 11 — 'εἰς τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἐπιθυμητὰς κακῶν' - 'eis to me einai hemas epithymetas kakon' - <q>so as not to be us desiring evil</q>. The preposition 'eis' here indicates the cause, purpose.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 8 — 'πορνεύωμεν' - 'porneuomen' - <q>to commit fornication</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 9 — 'ὑπὸ τῶν ὄφεων' - 'hypo ton opheon' - <q>by serpents</q>. The preposition 'hypo' here with the genitive case indicates the passive state of the verb in ancient Greek.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 10 — 'ὑπὸ τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ' - 'hypo tou alothreutou' - <q>by the destroyer</q>. Similarly to the previous, the genitive case indicates the passive state of the verb. Spiritually, those who are dissatisfied and complain, reproach unjustly, such people are destroyers, destroyers of themselves first of all.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 11 — 'εἰς οὓς τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων' - 'eis ous ta tele ton aionon' - <q>in whom the end of the age; to whom the end of the age</q>. Rather the second, because the end of the age is not in people, but came to them, approaches.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul writes that Old Testament events became prototypes and instruction (teaching) for his contemporary Christians, and better to understand for all Christians — because the last times continue from the time of the First Coming of Christ until the Second Coming of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Many researchers believe that what happened in the Old Testament bodily, in the New happens mainly spiritually — for example, if someone then died bodily through grave sins, then in the New this happens with the soul of such a person — it perishes spiritually, distancing itself from God. One can say that such a sequence corresponds to the sequence by which small children master the ability to sympathise with the pain of other people and animals — first they learn to be aware of someone's bodily pain through visible and noticeable signs, and later they also learn to sympathise with spiritual pain, which may be expressed not as visibly as bodily pain.
</p>
<p>
Here Paul also lists some well-known examples from the Old Testament with the thought that they should teach Christians faithfulness to God in its various manifestations (Paul lists some).
</p>
<p>
I note that life exclusively for material pleasures is equated here with idolatry, because such life puts the material in place of God. Modern man is often not inclined to think so, but one must understand that if a person lives for the material, then the meaning of their life, in their opinion, is reduced only to this, and such is also the goal. They then neglect what they are actually mainly created for — to be eternally happy in love with God. They are then to some extent <q>governed</q> (their thoughts, views, feelings, behaviour, etc. are determined) by the material world, and one can say that they to some extent serve it. Then the thought that this can be called idolatry, according to Paul, becomes closer to modern man, more accessible for understanding.
</p>
<p>
Christians, however, need to remember their calling.

<p>
<reading>(Matthew XVI, 6-12) </reading><br>
Matthew XVI, 6 — 'προσέχετε ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ Σαδδουκαί' - 'prosekhete apo tes zymes ton Pharisaion kai Saddoukai' - <q>pay attention to (be away) from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees</q>. The preposition 'apo' indicates here that one needs to be careful to keep away from the position of the Pharisees (convinced of their righteousness, blinded zealots of human traditions) and Sadducees (believers who actually lost faith in the effectiveness of God's power, occupied only with earthly things). When people join earthly, vain, sometimes also wrong things, when at the same time certain of their righteousness, then this without changing this attitude leads to decline, and sometimes also to resistance to God, as happened in the case of the Pharisees and Sadducees, who became hostile against Christ. Of course, one needs to pay attention to avoid such positions, because a person can be tempted similarly to them, even whilst being a Christian man or woman.
</p>
<p>
See more about the logic of the Pharisees and Sadducees at the link (regarding yesterday's reading):<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/28072025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/28072025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVI, 7, 8 — 'ἐν ἑαυτοῖς' - 'en heautois' - <q>within themselves; internally</q>. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVI, 11, 12 — 'ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης' - 'apo tes zymes' - <q>(away) from the leaven</q>. See above regarding verse 6. The preposition 'apo' emphasises that one needs to distance oneself in every way from Pharisaism and Sadduceeism (the latter is an image of disbelief). 'ἀπὸ τῆς διδαχῆς' - 'apo tes didakhes' - <q>from the teaching; from the doctrine</q> — see the explanation just now.
</p>
<p>
Direct continuation of yesterday's reading, where what enters into that <q>the leaven</q> was described in more detail. One needs to say that the question of a sign is only part of what one needs to beware of and to pay attention to, but a quite telling part. Examples of miracles of feeding people show that Christ loves bread, particularly leavened, and speaks about spirituality. The understanding of the disciples then was literal, material.
