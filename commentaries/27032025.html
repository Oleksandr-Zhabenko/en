<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Isaiah XXVIII, 22 — ‘παρὰ κυρίου σαβαωθ’ - ‘para kyriou sabaoth’ - ‘from beside the Lord of hosts’. The preposition ‘para’ is here with the genitive case. The same construction is used regarding the proceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father, as well as regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. More generally, this passage indicates that God already knows all the events that will take place for our salvation. Genesis XI, 6 — ‘οὐκ ἐκλείψει ἐξ αὐτῶν πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπιθῶνται ποιεῖν’ - ‘ouk eleipsei ex auton panta hosa an epithontai poiein’ - ‘nothing will stop them, no matter how many things they decide to create (to do, to perform)’. That is, indeed, human unity can be endless, uninterrupted. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that if people do something in complete unity, then in themselves, on their own, from themselves, there will be no reason to cease it, and only something external can change it. Christ, speaking of the unity of the disciples and saying that ‘if two or three of you agree on a particular thing to pray’, extends this idea further. Genesis XI, 3 — ‘εἰς λίθον’ - ‘eis lithon’ - ‘in the stone’. That is, the bricks became so solid as if they were a solid stone. Spiritually, this indicates that human unity can be as long-lasting and solid as the stones. Isaiah XXVIII, 16 — ‘ἐγὼ ἐμβαλῶ εἰς τὰ θεμέλια Σιων λίθον πολυτελῆ ἐκλεκτὸν ἀκρογωνιαῖον ἔντιμον εἰς τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς’ - ‘ego embalo eis ta themelia Sion lithon polytele eklekton akrogoniaion entimon eis ta themelia autes’ - ‘I will lay a very precious stone, a chosen cornerstone, in the foundations of Zion’. The ‘foundations’ of Zion are plural, and the ‘stone’ is singular. This is a well-known prophecy about Jesus Christ, which is mentioned in various places in the New Testament when referring to the cornerstone, as well as in the Revelation of John the Theologian regarding the New Jerusalem. These details indicate that Christ is the only Saviour, the Head of the Church, the Lord. They also indicate that there is no other way to God. They also speak of the Church and the sanctification of the faithful through union with Christ, in particular through the Eucharist. The repetition of the two words about value points to the God-humanity of Christ. The human nature of Jesus, like many other places in Scripture, is called a value, and it is clear that all human values make sense in relation to the human nature of Christ. Isaiah XXVIII, 17 — ‘κρίσιν εἰς ἐλπίδα’ - ‘krisin eis elpida’ - ‘judgement for hope’. ἡ δὲ ἐλεημοσύνη μου εἰς σταθμούς’ - ‘he de eleemousyne mou eis stathmous’ - ‘but My mercy (the manifestation of My mercy) into the measures; and My mercy into the stopping places’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates what God's judgement and mercy will become. Christ mentions this place in a slightly different way when He speaks of ‘judgement, mercy and faith’. People are often afraid of God's judgement, but when God's judgement becomes hope, and mercy becomes a measure or rest and stopping points along the way, when God repeatedly shows mercy and testifies to judgement, judges and this becomes hope, it means unity with God, a common path to the goal with Him, and in general, God's salvation. Proverbs XIV, 6 — ‘ζητήσεις σοφίαν παρὰ κακοῖς καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσεις αἴσθησις δὲ παρὰ φρονίμοις εὐχερής’ - ‘zeteseis sophian para kakois kai oukh eureseis aisthesis de para phronimois eukheres’ - ‘you will seek wisdom with the wicked (criminals) and will not find it, but perception is easy (accessible) with the intelligent (prudent)’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the dative case and indicates what happens to a person in an environment of different people - it is impossible to find wisdom, to become wise, next to bad people, while next to intelligent people one can easily learn, perception is open, unburdened by anything, which makes the cognition of truth, the wisdom, the maturity accessible and quite possible."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.

<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah XXVIII, 14-22) </reading><br>
Isaiah XXVIII, 14 — ‘ἐν Ιερουσαλημ’ - ‘en Ierousalem’ - ‘in Jerusalem’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 16 — ‘ἐγὼ ἐμβαλῶ εἰς τὰ θεμέλια Σιων λίθον πολυτελῆ ἐκλεκτὸν ἀκρογωνιαῖον ἔντιμον εἰς τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς’ - ‘ego embalo eis ta themelia Sion lithon polytele eklekton akrogoniaion entimon eis ta themelia autes’ - ‘I will lay a very precious stone, a chosen cornerstone, in the foundations of Zion’. The ‘foundations’ of Zion are plural, and the ‘stone’ is singular. This is a well-known prophecy about Jesus Christ, which is mentioned in various places in the New Testament when referring to the cornerstone, as well as in the Revelation of John the Theologian regarding the New Jerusalem. These details indicate that Christ is the only Saviour, the Head of the Church, the Lord. They also indicate that there is no other way to God.

The repetition of the two words about value points to the God-humanity of Christ.

</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 17 — ‘κρίσιν εἰς ἐλπίδα’ - ‘krisin eis elpida’ - ‘judgement for hope’. ‘ἡ δὲ ἐλεημοσύνη μου εἰς σταθμούς’ - ‘he de eleemousyne mou eis stathmous’ - ‘but My mercy (the manifestation of My mercy) into the measures; and My mercy into the stopping places’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates what God's judgement and mercy will become. Christ mentions this place in a slightly different way when He speaks of ‘judgement, mercy and faith’.

</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 18 — ‘εἰς καταπάτημα’ - ‘eis katapatema’ - ‘for trampling; to be trampled’. That is, a crushing defeat.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 19 — ‘ἐν νυκτὶ’ - ‘en nykti’ - ‘in the night’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 21 — ‘ἐν τῇ φάραγγι Γαβαων’ - ‘en te pharaggi Gabaon’ - ‘in the valley of Gibeon’.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah XXVIII, 22 — ‘παρὰ κυρίου σαβαωθ’ - ‘para kyriou sabaoth’ - ‘from beside the Lord of hosts’. The preposition ‘para’ is here with the genitive case. The same construction is used regarding the proceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father, as well as regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ.

This indicates that this is a reference to God's Revelation in the Holy Spirit, which is related to the Incarnation of the Son of God. More generally, this passage indicates that God already knows all the events that will take place for our salvation.

At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis X, 32-XI, 9) </reading><br>
Genesis X, 32 — ‘ἀπὸ τούτων διεσπάρησαν νῆσοι τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς’ - ‘apo touton diesparesan nesoi ton ethnon epi pasan ten gen’ - ‘from these the islands of the nations were scattered like grain over the whole earth’. That is, various separate peoples and nations settled as descendants of the sons of Noah. In general, it is not clear whether the earth refers to the area where the flood took place or to some other area. 
</p>
<p>
Genesis XI, 2 — ‘ἐν τῷ κινῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν’ - ‘en to kinesai autous apo anatolon’ - ‘as they moved from the east’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that they left the east (the place of sunrise) and spiritually means that they left God. ‘ἐν γῇ Σεννααρ’ - ‘en ge Sennaar’ - ‘in the land of Shinar’. 
</p>
<p>
Genesis XI, 3 — ‘εἰς λίθον’ - ‘eis lithon’ - ‘in the stone’. That is, the bricks became so solid as if they were a solid stone. Spiritually, this indicates that human unity can be as long-lasting and solid as the stones.
</p>
<p>
Genesis XI, 6 — ‘οὐκ ἐκλείψει ἐξ αὐτῶν πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπιθῶνται ποιεῖν’ - ‘ouk eleipsei ex auton panta hosa an epithontai poiein’ - ‘nothing will stop them, no matter how many things they decide to create (to do, to perform)’. That is, indeed, human unity can be endless, uninterrupted. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that if people do something in complete unity, then in themselves, on their own, from themselves, there will be no reason to cease it, and only something external can change it. Christ, speaking of the unity of the disciples and saying that ‘if two or three of you agree on a particular thing to pray’, extends this idea further. See in particular the following links:<br>

<reading>(Proverbs XIII, 20-XIV, 6) </reading><br>
Proverbs XIII, 23 — ‘δίκαιοι ποιήσουσιν ἐν πλούτῳ ἔτη πολλά’ - ‘dikaioi poiesousin en plouto ete polla’ - ‘the righteous will create (do) in wealth many years’. That is, they will be long-lived.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIV, 3 — ‘ἐκ στόματος ἀφρόνων’ - ‘ek stomatos aphonon’ - ‘out of the mouth of the foolish; out of the mouth of the insane’. That is, from where.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs XIV, 6 — ‘ζητήσεις σοφίαν παρὰ κακοῖς καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσεις αἴσθησις δὲ παρὰ φρονίμοις εὐχερής’ - ‘zeteseis sophian para kakois kai oukh eureseis aisthesis de para phronimois eukheres’ - ‘you will seek wisdom with the wicked (criminals) and will not find it, but perception is easy (accessible) with the intelligent (prudent)’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the dative case and indicates what happens to a person in an environment of different people - it is impossible to find wisdom, to become wise, next to bad people, while next to intelligent people one can easily learn, perception is open, unburdened by anything, which makes the cognition of truth, the wisdom, the maturity accessible and quite possible.
