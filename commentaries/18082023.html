<p>There are two readings today, joined together in one sequence, as
tomorrow is a great celebration. The dailyy Apostle (of Friday): (2
Corinthians IV, 13-18) 2 Corinthians IV:13  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’ -
‘we’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians IV, 14  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians IV:16, 17, 18  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’. ‘ημερα’ -
‘emera’  &ndash; (to) ‘day’. ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘us’ (for us).</p>
<p>Paul had previously spoken about the difficulties, challenges and
temptations of the apostolic work, so here he says that they cannot be
compared to the eternal glory in Christ after the resurrection of the
dead.</p>
<p>The <q>inner man</q> can be understood primarily as the heart of a person,
as the core of their personality and life. More about this understanding
is available here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Adultery-briefly.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Adultery-briefly.html</a><br></p>
<p>The <q>outer man</q> refers, first of all, to the totality of the various
circumstances of the apostles and many believers lives. For example, the
circumstances of the apostolic work do not allow the apostles to become
rich (they do not seek it), but contribute to their growth in Christ and
eternal reward in glory.</p>
<p>For the Saturday: (1 Corinthians I, 3-9) See the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="11072023.html">11072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The daily Gospel (for Friday): (Matthew XXIV, 27-33, 42-51) For the
first part, see here:

<p>For the second part:
<br><a class="link2" href="11042023.html">11042023.html</a><br></p>
<p>For the Saturday: (Matthew XIX, 3-12) The understanding of this
passage differs between Orthodox and Roman Catholics. I will not dwell
on this in detail now, but it will be seen later what I think Christ is
saying here.</p>
<p>I have mentioned this place before in other posts, see, in
particular:

<p>Now I will present my thoughts on how to understand these words. I
hope that they come from God.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First of all, it is clear that Christ denies the understanding of
Marriage as a purely human institution that emerges and develops
according to human laws and rules, including the possibility of
arbitrary understanding and the possibility of entering into and
divorcing a marriage quite arbitrarily. No, Marriage has its origin in
God, it is part of God’s intention (like the family and society) and
cannot be treated as if everything is determined by people alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Marriage itself is a gift from God. But not every human marriage is
established in accordance with God’s will; the situation here is much
like the situation with authority. I wrote about the authority at the
following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="29072023.html">29072023.html</a><br></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Divorce is not established by God, it is a human phenomenon, but
Christ says that <q>Moses allowed divorce because of the hardheartedness
of the people</q>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, Moses sees the inability to divorce as a form
of punishment. In the Law of Moses, it is described that if a boy and a
girl (man and woman) have sexual relations without being engaged to
another, they must marry and will not be able to divorce for all their
lives (as long as they live) as a punishment for dishonour (see
Deuteronomy XXII, 13-19, 28-29).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In view of this, it is difficult to say whether the Church has
(should have) divorce as such. The verses from Matthew V discussed above
and this reading suggest that fornication is a possible cause of
divorce.</p>
<p>I would also like to recall the story of the Nativity of Christ -
Joseph, when he discovered that Mary was pregnant, wanted to secretly
let Her go (they were engaged, that is, they were to be fidelitous, but
not yet married), but was assured by an angel in a dream that <q>he should
not be afraid to take Mary as his wife</q> (in chastity, virginity). In
other words, the desire to divorce may be connected with fear, which is
why the Angel says <q>Do not fear</q>.</p>
<p>In general, as far as I understand, Roman Catholics do not recognise
such a thing as divorce in a solemnised marriage, but in the case of
adultery, they believe that the marriage was invalid.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Divorce can also be part of adultery, unless it is justified by the
other person’s guilt of fornication, and is followed by another
marriage. If someone marries another person the day after the divorce
(or on the same day), then the fact of adultery is said to be evident.
But Christ says that the time distance between these two events does not
matter for the human heart, for the person themselves. That is, even if
the second marriage is remarried a long time after the divorce not
because of fornication, adultery remains as such. We can see that Christ
values marital love  &ndash; a second marriage contradicts the unity of true
love in marriage.</li>
</ol>
