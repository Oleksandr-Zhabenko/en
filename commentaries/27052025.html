it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts XVII, 19-28 ) </reading><br>
Acts XVII, 19 — ‘αὕτη ἡ ὑπὸ σοῦ λαλουμένη διδαχή’ - ‘aute he hypo sou laloumene didakhe’ - ‘this doctrine spoken by you’. <br>
The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle ‘spoken’.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 20 — ‘εἰσφέρεις εἰς τὰς ἀκοὰς ἡμῶν’ - ‘eisphereis eis tas akoas hemon’ - ‘you bring into our ears’. The same word as in the Lord's Prayer ‘lead us not into temptation/trial’. See more here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01032025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01032025.html</a><br>
It means ‘what doctrine do you offer us, what do you introduce to us’ (in a similar sense to ‘to put forward a proposal for consideration’). The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates the direction of Paul's words.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 21 — ‘εἰς οὐδὲν ἕτερον’ - ‘eis ouden heteron’ - ‘for something else’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here the purpose and the desired result of the actions of these people.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 22 — ‘ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρίου πάγου’ - ‘en meso tou Ariou pagou’ - ‘in the midst of the Areopagus’. Where. The preposition is a part of a common expression.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 23 — ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in which; where’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 24 — ‘τὸν κόσμον καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘ton kosmon kai panta ta en auto’ - ‘the world and all that is in it’. What and where. ‘οὐκ ἐν χειροποιήτοις ναοῖς κατοικεῖ’ - ‘ouk en kheiropoietois naois katoikei’ - ‘does not live in human-made shrines’. Where. It is important to note that the word used here is not the word ‘temple’, for example, the Jerusalem temple, but ‘sanctuary, shrine, temple in the broad sense’. 
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 25 — ‘οὐδὲ ὑπὸ χειρῶν ἀνθρωπίνων θεραπεύεται προσδεόμενός τινος’ - ‘oude hypo kheiron anthropinon theraeuetai prosdeomenos tinos’ - ‘not a single care (‘treatment’, service) (done) by human hands wants more’. <br>
This means that it is not people who care for God, but He Who cares for people. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case and indicates with what the care is made which God does not need.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 26 — ‘ἐποίησέν τε ἐξ ἑνὸς πᾶν ἔθνος ἀνθρώπων κατοικεῖν ἐπὶ παντὸς προσώπου τῆς γῆς’ - ‘epoiesen te ex henos pan ethnos anthropon katoikein epi pantos prosopou tes ges’ - ‘and created from one the whole human race, that dwell upon the face (surface) of the earth; He made both from one all the human race that lives upon the face of the earth’. Both translations are possible here. The first one indicates the direct descent of people living on the then known territory from a single Adam, and the second one - from a single Adam through Eve. It is also important to note the singular ‘people race’ - all people are ‘one people’, i.e. humankind.

</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 27 — ‘οὐ μακρὰν ἀπὸ ἑνὸς ἑκάστου ἡμῶν ὑπάρχοντα’ - ‘ou makran apo henos hekastou hemon hyparkhonta’ - ‘not far from one each of us is; is not far from each of us’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the distance is referred to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XVII, 28 — ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in Him’. In Him we live because He gives life; we move because He created space, time, forms of motion of matter and all the like, gives us strength and so on; we exist because thanks to Him we do not pass into nothingness but are such that we exist. One can also see here the transitions and interweaving of the most diverse forms and spheres of human existence - of each person in particular, groups and all of humanity, as well as of the rest of creation.
