<p>
For the 9th hour:<br>
<reading>(Titus II, 11-14, III, 4-7; Matthew III, 13-17) </reading><br>
The reading from the Apostle is preceded by the one described here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15122023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15122023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Matthew III, 15 &mdash; '·º°Œº·øñŒΩ' - 'emin' - (to) 'us'.
</p>
<p>
The word <q>heaven</q> is used in the plural form (heavens), as we often see in the Scriptures.
</p>
<p>
The Gospel reading is from Matthew's narrative of the Baptism of Jesus Christ from John in the Jordan River.
</p>
<p>
It is a well-known reading, <br>
in which we see the true manifestation of God as Trinity, <br>
as the Son is baptised, <br>
the Father testifies with a voice from heaven, <br>
and the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians IX, 19-27) </reading><br>
The reading from the Apostle is preceded by the one described here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24072023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24072023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians IX, 19 &mdash; '·ºêŒºŒ±œÖœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ' - 'emauton' - 'myself'.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians IX, 25 &mdash; '·º°ŒºŒµ·øñœÇ' - 'emeis' - 'we'.
</p>
<p>
<q>beating the air</q> &mdash; to miss the target, to waste energy (synonymous with sin in some cases, but here it is more a matter of failure, defeat, than sin).
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul first talks about how he tries to be one of them for all those to whom he preaches. This is actually an art to some extent.
</p>
<p>
He uses the word <q>Law</q> in different senses, which makes his thoughts seem somewhat contradictory, but they are actually consistent. The Law of Moses was not the key to Paul's actions, so he says that <q>I was not really under the Law</q>, but the Law of Jesus Christ, that is, the Law of love, Christ's commandments, was the Law for Paul.
</p>
<p>
Such closeness to people does not guarantee that the preaching will be accepted and people will believe, but it removes certain obstacles that very often otherwise get in the way.
</p>
<p>
Paul goes on to compare athletes, but the apostle's feat is greater because it is intended to lead people to eternal salvation.
</p>
<p>
Every feat requires and presupposes a certain amount of restraint, to which Paul calls all believers, as well as zeal and diligence, as well as wisdom and discernment.
</p>
<p>
Paul also notes here that a preacher can lead others to faith and yet fall. This is because a person is often not all in the activity of preaching. Preaching becomes a strength for the preacher, and weaknesses require additional attention and work.<br>
 <br>
<reading>(Luke III, 1-18) </reading><br>
Luke III, 14 &mdash; '·º°ŒºŒµ·øñœÇ' - 'emeis' - 'we'.
</p>
<p>
Luke III, 16 &mdash; 'Œµ·º∞Œº·Ω∂' - 'eimi' - (not) 'I am'.
</p>
<p>
The story of John the Baptist, his preaching, and its significance in preparing people for the coming of Christ.
</p>

<p>
John's teaching can be summarised as an explanation of the commandments of love for neighbours and a call to active love in anticipation of the Messiah, the Christ.

<p>
During the consecration of water:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians X, 1-4; Mark I, 9-11) </reading><br>
The Gospel readings repeat the readings of the 6th hour in part.<br>
The immediate continuation of the readings from the Apostle is the one described here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25072023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25072023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians X, 1 &mdash; '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).
</p>
<p>
Here Paul speaks of the universality of the prototype of New Testament Baptism in the Old Testament, when the Israelites travelled in the desert under the leadership of Moses. That is, it was not an action for the righteous alone, but for the whole people of God.
</p>
<p>
Christ was not Incarnate at that time, so it is a prototype, but symbolically the Old Testament cloud was a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ and Baptism.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
