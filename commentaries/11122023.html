The apostle Paul compares the world to a great building of God, in which different people are different vessels.
</p>
<p>
Just as a person prepares themselves to meet God, to be God's temple, God's home, so the Lord's grace gives them goods &mdash; to those who have prepared themselves well, grace gives them higher gifts, and to those who have prepared themselves less well, grace gives them gifts with prudence, but still extremely generously.
</p>
<p>
We need to remember that preparation itself does not arise solely from a person's desire (he or she wants to do it and just does it), but under the influence of God's grace, which calls the person to sanctification, sanctifies them, and first leads them to purification and preparation, growth, etc. A person can respond to many calls of grace, or they can neglect and reject or even resist grace. If we recall the Parable of the Ten Thousand Talents, i.e. the enormous and unprecedented wealth that a person received, we can see that often people do not align their lives with the work of God's grace. At the same time, we see the generosity of God, the God who sends <q>the sun on the evil and the good, and the rain on the just and the unjust</q>, also calls us to perfection.
