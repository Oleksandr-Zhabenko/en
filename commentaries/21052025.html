it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Where to. ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῶν' - <q>ap auton</q> - <q>from them</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that John has completely left them. ‘εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα’ - ‘eis Hierosolyma’ - ‘to Jerusalem’. Where to.

<p>
<reading>(John VI, 5-14) </reading><br>
John VI, 8 — ‘εἷς ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ, Ἀνδρέας ὁ ἀδελφὸς Σίμωνος Πέτρου’ - ‘heis ek ton matheton autou, Andreas ho adelphos Simonos Petrou’ - ‘one of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter’.

</p>
<p>
John VI, 9 — ‘εἰς τοσούτους’ - ‘eis tosoutous’ - ‘for so many’. A somewhat colloquial shortening of the phrase, it is quite possible that it is quoted verbatim from a quote that John remembered well. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates a destination.

</p>
<p>
John VI, 13 — ‘ἐκ τῶν πέντε ἄρτων τῶν κριθίνων’ - ‘ek ton pente arton ton krithinon’ - ‘of five barley loaves’. Similarly to verse 11, the preposition ‘ek’ here indicates that the multiplied loaves were nutritious and delicious.

<p>
To the Co-apostolic Saints Constantine and Helen:<br>
<reading>(Acts XXVI, 1-5, 12-20; John X, 1-9) </reading><br>
Acts XXVI, 2 — ‘περὶ πάντων ὧν ἐγκαλοῦμαι ὑπὸ Ἰουδαίων’ - ‘peri panton on enkaleumai hypo Ioudaion’ - ‘about all that (I) am accused of by the Jews’. The preposition ‘hypo’ is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle ‘am accused’.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 4 — ‘τὴν μὲν οὖν βίωσίν μου τὴν ἐκ νεότητος τὴν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς γενομένην ἐν τῷ ἔθνει μου ἔν τε Ἱεροσολύμοις' - ‘ten men oun biosin mou ten ek neotetos ten ap arkhes genomenen en to ethnei mou en te Hierosolymois’ - ‘therefore, the true manner of my life, which from my youth, which from the beginning was among my nation in the Jerusalemites’. That is, the way Saul (the future, and at the time of his conversation with the king, the present apostle Paul) actually lived. The first preposition ‘ek’ indicates that Saul had become devout and reverent from his youth, i.e. this was a mature and adult decision at a young age. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the count, i.e. it refers to Saul's conscious life, not to the period when he was a baby, which he does not remember. The prepositions ‘en’ indicate medium, society, and surroundings.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 12 — ‘Ἐν οἷς πορευόμενος εἰς τὴν Δαμασκὸν’ - ‘En hois poreuomenos eis ten Damaskon’ - ‘(When) in these (matters) (I) went to Damascus’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 14 — ‘εἰς τὴν γῆν’ - ‘eis ten gen’ - ‘to the ground; to the earth’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 16 — ‘εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ’ - ‘eis touto gar’ - ‘for this is why’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 17 — ‘ἐξαιρούμενός σε ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, εἰς οὓς ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω σε’ - ‘exairoumenos se ek tou laou kai ek ton ethnon, eis hous ego apostello se' - ’I deliver you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you (as an apostle); I choose you from the people and from the nations (Gentiles) to whom I am sending you; I set you apart from the people (Jews) and from the nations (Gentiles) to whom I am sending you’. Various translations are possible, indicating both Paul's election and vocation as an apostle of the nations and the defence and salvation of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 18 — ‘ἀπὸ σκότους εἰς φῶς’ - ‘apo skotous eis phos’ - ‘’out of darkness into light; from darkness to light‘’. From (out of) where and (in)to where. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that one must leave the darkness completely, entirely, utterly, absolutely resolutely. ‘κλῆρον ἐν τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις’ - ‘kleron en tois egiasmenois’ - ‘lot in the sanctified’. That is, the gift of holiness and participation in the community of saints. ‘πίστει τῇ εἰς ἐμέ’ - ‘pistei te eis eme’ - ‘by faith that is into Me’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here that Christ is the goal and destination of the faith, it leads to Him. 
</p>
<p>
Acts XXVI, 20 — ‘τοῖς ἐν Δαμασκῷ πρῶτόν τε καὶ Ἱεροσολύμοις, πᾶσάν τε τὴν χώραν τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ τοῖς ἔθνεσιν’ - ‘tois en Damasko proton te kai Hierosolymois, pasan te ten khoran tes Ioudaias kai tois ethnesin' - <q>first to those in Damascus, also to the Jerusalemites, to the whole land of the Jews and to the Gentiles</q>. To whom the Apostle Paul preached.
