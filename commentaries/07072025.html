Another example is that if Christians are forced to renounce their faith or part of it for the sake of peace with non-believers, then such proposals should be rejected and defeated completely.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans XII, 4-5, 15-21) </reading><br>
Romans XII, 4 — 'ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι πολλὰ μέλη ἔχομεν' - 'en heni somati polla mele ekhomen' - <q>in one body we have many members</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 5 — 'ἐν Χριστῷ' - 'en CHristo' - <q>in Christ</q>. Indicates that being in Christ, the faithful become united, become one whole, a wholesome mystical church organism.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 16 — 'τὸ αὐτὸ εἰς ἀλλήλους φρονοῦν' - 'to auto eis allelous phronoun' - <q>the same thing think one towards another; the same thing think one for another</q>. That is, unity of mind is valuable not in itself, but for creating community, commonality. 'μὴ γίνεσθε φρόνιμοι παρ' ἑαυτοῖς' - 'me ginesthe phronimoi par heautois' - <q>do not become rich in thoughts near others (faithful)</q>. 'par' before a vowel with the dative case here means <q>near</q>. The phrase means that the faithful should not compete over who among them is a more deep-thinking person, who is more careful, cautious, far-sighted, etc. More about this see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid05PhidJjaBaxWEV3WJJUUeXCyScbNp5qXpD9i8Ha23ubCNbgB8X237Aq3sgVpNkVrl" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/</a>
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 17 — 'προνοομενοι' - 'pronooumenoi' - <q>thinking ahead, provide</q>. Important words for building (creating) peace.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 18 — 'εἰ δυνατόν, τὸ ἐξ ὑμῶν μετὰ πάντων ἀνθρώπων εἰρηνεύοντες' - 'ei dynaton to ex hymon meta panton anthropon eireneuontes' - <q>if possible (if able), this from you, with all people live in peace</q>. Here the preposition 'ex' (form 'ek' before a vowel) indicates that if the cause of discord and absence of peace are the Christians themselves, then they violate this commandment of the apostle. Christians should not be the source and cause of conflicts, if this is within their power and capabilities. At the same time, these words in no way forbid fighting for peace when you or others are attacked, which, for example, the brave defenders and defendresses of Ukraine and Europe are now doing. Another example is that if Christians are forced to renounce their faith or part of it for the sake of <q>peace</q> with non-believers, then such proposals should be rejected and defeated completely. The faith of Christians does not depend on them, because it is given by God. Therefore, one cannot renounce it. The faith of Christians is not from themselves, but from God.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 21 — 'μὴ νικῶ ὑπὸ τοῦ κακοῦ, ἀλλὰ νίκα ἐν τῷ ἀγαθῷ τὸ κακόν' - 'me niko hypo tou kakou, alla vika en to agatho to kakon' - <q>do not be conquered by evil (as an acting force), but conquer in (with) good the evil</q>. In other words: do not submit to evil, but, being good, conquer evil with goodness. Christians should not be <q>a third party in the struggle of good and evil</q>, it is impossible to defeat evil in a Christian way without being good, without being in good. There is no Christian victory over evil if it is not accomplished and achieved in good.<br>
Also very relevant words in connection with the war of the Russians with Ukraine. The violation and incomplete understanding of these words of the apostle today is one of the prerequisites for the appearance of the <q>Russian world</q>.

General instructions for Christian life.

<p>
I will stop only on anger and revenge. More about this I wrote at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/11062025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/11062025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07062023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/07062023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
<q>To give place to God's wrath,</q> — this is precisely what a Christian needs to do with their own anger, if it is truly righteous. At the same time, one needs to fight evil. In particular, in war one needs to stop evil (therefore the so-called <q>defensive, just war</q> is needed), but the person themselves should not be emotionally angry.

<p>
<reading>(Matthew XII, 9-13) </reading><br>
Matthew XII, 9 — 'εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν αὐτῶν' - 'eis ten synagogen auton' - <q>into their synagogue</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XII, 11 — 'ἐξ ὑμῶν' - 'ex hymon' - <q>among (from amongst) you</q>. The preposition 'ek' in its form before the following 'hy' indicates that that person is a representative of the community of people, that is, actually a human being. 'εἰς βόθυνον' - 'eis bothynon' - <q>into a pit</q>. Where. 'οὐχὶ κρατησει αὐτὸ καὶ ἐγερεῖ' - 'oukhi kratesei auto kai egerei' - <q>will not apply effort, will not show strength regarding it and will not lift (pull out)</q>. That is, in comparison with God, about Whom this is also spoken here, God shows strength and lifts up (synonym resurrects) the faithful.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XII, 13 — 'απεκατεσταθη' - 'apekatestathe' - <q>was restored to the initial state</q> (healthy).
