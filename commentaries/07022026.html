it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy III, 1-9) </reading><br>
2 Timothy III, 1 — &#39;ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις&#39; — &#39;en eskhatais hemerais&#39; - <q>in the last days</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III, 6 — &#39;ἐκ τούτων&#39; — &#39;ek touton&#39; - <q>from such</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here belonging to the group of precisely such people. &#39;εἰς τὰς οἰκίας&#39; - &#39;eis tas oikias&#39; - <q>into houses</q>. Whither.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy III, 7 — &#39;εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας&#39; — &#39;eis epignosin aletheias&#39; - <q>to cognition (knowledge) of truth</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the direction, whither to come.
</p>
<p>
Paul describes people of the last times. As I wrote recently concerning the epistles of the Apostle Peter, not all people will be such, but each of the named sins, passions, errors and so forth will have many <q>adherents</q>, people who will be such and will consider this the norm. By Paul here are named tendencies whither paganism, unbelief and so on move, which, not having some reliable foundation, can <q>drift</q> under the action of desires of people. People who will seek truth, good, true beauty will be different. Here is described more the state of people who have lost faith in true values.

<p>
<reading>(Luke XX, 45-XXI, 4) </reading><br>
Luke XX, 46 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων&#39; — &#39;apo ton grammateon&#39; - <q>from (those) scribes(, who)</q>. That is, precisely such as the following. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that one needs to beware of them, to avoid. &#39;ἐν στολαῖς&#39; - &#39;en stolais&#39; - <q>in long robes</q>. &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς&#39; - &#39;en tais agorais&#39; - <q>in the places of trade and assemblies of people</q>. &#39;ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς&#39; - &#39;en tais synagogais&#39; - <q>in the synagogues</q>. &#39;ἐν τοῖς δείπνοις&#39; - &#39;en tois deipnois&#39; - <q>at the banquets</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 1 — &#39;εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον&#39; — &#39;eis to gazophylakion&#39; - <q>into the treasury</q>. Whither.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 4 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος&#39; — &#39;ek tou perisseuontos&#39; - <q>from that which overflows</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates from whence that is taken. &#39;εἰς τὰ δῶρα&#39; - &#39;eis ta dora&#39; - <q>into gifts</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates that there occurs transformation of something into a gift to God. &#39;ἐκ τοῦ ὑστερήματος&#39; - &#39;ek tou hysterematos&#39; - <q>out of want; out of poverty</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first is logically better. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates out of what that is taken.

<p>
Exposure of hypocrisy, and also praise of the poor widow and her modest gift of love and poverty. A story which often inspired people to monasticism, in particular to voluntary poverty for the sake of drawing near to God. A well-known thought about that God looks first of all upon our hearts, in particular also concerning the value of offerings and gifts.
</p>
<p>
Both parts are united by one thought — if the person does something which is connected with faith not by virtue of a sincere heart, but in view of other reasons, for example tradition, social structure, level of social development and so on, then this does not make him truly righteous, and can also <q>occupy the holy place</q> of true relations with God and people, make the person almost incorrigible and tempt others to that.
