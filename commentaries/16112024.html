it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(2 Corinthians III, 12-18 ) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians III, 13 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ τέλος’ - ‘eis to telos’ - ‘into the end; into the completion'. We can think of the word ‘gazed’ in the sense that Moses wanted his old age not to distract from the cognition of God. At the same time, God wanted the glory of Moses' face to also encourage people to know God. Although Moses was formally trying to do the <q>opposite</q> of God (hiding his face, which God wanted to glorify), they were working together towards the same common goal - to promote the knowledge and glorification of God. 
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians III, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ’ - ‘en CHristo’ - ‘in Christ; by Christ’. Both translations are possible, the first emphasising life in Christ, and the second that He Himself removes this ‘veil’.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians III, 18 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν’ - ‘apo doxes eis doxan’ - ‘from glory to glory; out of glory into glory’. The preposition ‘apo’ is used here instead of the more commonly used preposition ‘ek’. The former emphasises that people ‘come out and leave’ the old for the new. A similar logic is found in the Gospels in the parables of the new wineskins and the new clothes. See more at the following links:<br>

‘ἀπὸ κυρίου πνεύματος’ &mdash; ‘apo kyriou pneumatos’ - ‘from the Spirit of the Lord’. Here the preposition ‘apo’ is used in a different sense, emphasising that it is a gift of the Holy Spirit.

<p>
<reading>(Luke IX, 57-62) </reading><br>
Luke IX, 57 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ’ - ‘en te hodo’ - ‘on the way; on the road’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 61 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν οἶκόν’ - ‘eis ton oikon’ - ‘into the house; in the house’. In the sense of ‘domestic’.
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 62 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω’ - ‘eis ta opiso’ - ‘into what is behind’. That is, ‘backwards’.
