<meta name="description" content="The text emphasizes that if you are the first, the elder, then serve according to Christ’s example. This challenges the focus on seeking prominence within Christianity. Instead, it redefines greatness through service, directly mirroring Christ's humility. It is also stated to be remembered that the devil did not ask Jesus, but God the Father, to sift. Satan's request is a special tradition in Luke.">

<p><reading>(3 John I, 1-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the daily Apostle read 3rd Epistle of the Apostle
John the Theologian. Written for Gaius, apprentice of the apostle.</p>
<p>John praises him, wishes him God’s assistance in all matters, bodily
health, that he may continue to live righteously in Christ.</p>
<p>He teaches to continue to accept with honour and love the faithful
who work selflessly for the glory of God.</p>
<p>3 John I, 11 is an interesting detail: who does good (real, which is
not necessarily an exemplary behavior) and by this lives, that is <q>from
God</q> (as the Source), that is, as if given by God to the world as a
witness of God’s glory and love, God’s goodness. Contrary, a person who
does true evil <q>did not see (did not peer carefully, did not consider,
did not pay real close attention to, did not stare at) God</q> — in fact,
about the absence of a real relationship with God. And those who do not
do evil have <q>seen God,</q> that is, as those who love Him, who <q>looked
carefully into God’s face</q> and saw God’s love. Ancient priestly the
blessing contains as one of the words: <q>Let the Lord shine with His face
upon you and show you mercy! May the Lord lift up His face upon you and
give you peace!</q> (4 Moses VI, 26-27).</p>
<p>The apostle John greets his friends as well. It is quite natural to
complete the letter.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XIX, 29-40, XXII, 7-39) </reading>
</p>
<p>Reading the Gospel is about the
glorious Entrance of the Lord to Jerusalem, about the Last Supper. Very
deep texts given all the significance to our salvation of these
events.</p>
<p>I will not dwell on many points, only a few.</p>
<p>

<q>Stones will scream</q> <br>
— what God has truly ordained and does, <br>
then, even if people don't want to, <br>
will be accomplished by the power of God, <br>
superb to the laws of nature. <br>
<br>
But God wants to <q>humanize</q> His will,<br>
not that it was a miracle, <br>
and so that people <q>were a miracle</q>, <br>
and it is better to say — that their lives,<br>
even if they are not recognized <br>
and confessed as a miracle, but were<br>
by the exercise of God's will and <br>
a testimony of His love.
</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXII, 24-27) </reading>
</p>
<p>is about what greater Christians need to do.
Unlike described in the work on this subject at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid05cESd4XwpG6B5AoQebRutYwswE2N7TKW8tdy6rmFLgHx87Zu4ZLqbDgSy1wR4Z2vl" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a><br>
here <q>let it be</q> is in the imperative mood and is God’s commandment. To
sum up, God does not want that we would like to be <q>first (prior,
higher, more significant) Christians</q>, does not want us to seek primacy,
teaches that such people will be the last and servants of all, but those
who are greater, major (more significant in activity), the Lord teaches
to serve by His own example — in short — <q>do not wish primacy as a
Christian, but if you are the first, then serve by the example of
Christ.</q> These words are especially relevant on World Social Justice Day
that exists today.</p>
<p><q>Behold, Satan demanded to have all of you to sift like wheat</q> — a
special Tradition of Luke, which other evangelists did not write down —
the devil did not ask Jesus, but God the Father. The request was not a
manifestation of love, but similar to the prayers of evil people who ask
for evil (unfortunately, there are some). A warning to those who think
that prayer is valuable in itself, <q>focusing consciousness,</q> considering
that even the devil can <q>pray</q> like that, but the benefit of it is that
he only gains sins.</p>
<p>On the establishment of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, Holy
Communion, I will not stop now, God willing, I’ll write about that
later.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
