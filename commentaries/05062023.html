<p>The commandment <q>be filled with the Holy Spirit</q> means to be open to
Him, His work, and to co-operate with Him. It is important to respond to
His call. I wrote about the fact that a person has such an opportunity
here:

<p>By the way, St Cecilia of Rome, the patron saint of musicians, is
said to have sung spiritual songs in her heart.</p>

- ‘before the face, before’ (the Father).</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 19  &ndash; ‘συμφωνησωσιν’  &ndash; ‘symphonesosin’  &ndash; ‘will be in
harmony’.</p>
<p>Matthew 18:20  &ndash; ‘εμον’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘My’ (name). ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I)
‘am’. It is used for emphasis.</p>

<p>As for the commandment <q>If your brother sins against you…</q>, I will
dwell on it in more detail here.</p>
<p>In order to fulfil this commandment in the form given by the Lord
Jesus, one must… have good brothers and sisters in Christ, and even
better, friends to support them. <q>Tell the Church…</q> is a multifaceted
phrase, historically most often referred to the decisions of Ecumenical
Councils, when the testimony of the entire Church determined what was
accepted and what was rejected. But in the plane of personal life, there
is no need to bring the case of sin to the Ecumenical Council. It is
often understood that the Church is understood as a common pastor for
the participants in the situation  &ndash; for example, a bishop. But this
requires that all participants really respect the opinion of the
hierarch. In any case, we see how strong the relationships of the
faithful should be, according to the commandment, so that there are
those who want to support them. And what if no one comes forward (for
example, because of timidity, or lack of confidence, or for other
reasons)? How should a person treat the sins of others, including those
committed against him or her?</p>
<p>If we look at the general tradition, and more specifically at the
commandments to the apostles and the faithful, for example, not to think
ahead about what to say to persecutors at the judgement for the faith,
as I wrote about earlier, we see that these words, along with others,
mean that we should not hold a grudge, should not be attached to
someone’s sins. When you need to think about what to say and how to say
it, you need to think about it and then say it.</p>
<p>We need to fight against sins, but we should not become attached to
them.</p>
<p>As for <q>bind… loose</q>  &ndash; this means everywhere <q>in Christ, according to
His will</q>. There is a good essay on fulfilment at this link (it is about
faith and prayer, but it also applies to these words):
