<p><reading>(1 Corinthians I, 10-18) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians I, 10  &ndash; ‘κατηρρισμενοι’ -
‘katerrismenoi’  &ndash; <q>were in the best condition, were perfect in their
best states, applications</q>. In other words, Paul warns against
divisions, teaches (asks for) unanimity, and in this  &ndash; differences, and
in this  &ndash; the best development together.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians I, 12  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used for
emphasis. The following thoughts are closely related to the faith in the
One and Only Redeemer Jesus Christ, which I wrote about earlier here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>
<p>Since those who were dividing among themselves in this way had
completely forgotten and neglected the foundations of the faith, Paul
reminds them of them. According to Paul’s words, they even went so far
as to think that the person of the baptiser became a kind of <q>key</q> to
further salvation  &ndash; the Corinthians began to think that the question of
who baptised them was more important than the common faith and unity of
the Church. Of course, Paul denies this, in a rather emotional way.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians I, 15  &ndash; ‘εμον’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; (in) ‘my’ (name).</p>
<p>1 Corinthians I, 17  &ndash; here Paul clearly distinguishes between the
important and the secondary. If Christ had called Paul to baptise, he
would not have thanked God (here he uses an extremely emotional
counter-argument to the Corinthians’ thoughts, probably the best way to
stop them from dividing) that he had not baptised almost anyone. But
since this was not the main focus of his ministry, he was willing to
show Christian flexibility.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians I, 18  &ndash; I wrote more about this by following the links:

<p><reading>(Matthew XIV, 14-22) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XIV, 22  &ndash; ‘εμβηναι’  &ndash; ‘embenai’  &ndash; <q>to
enter</q> (into the boat).</p>
<p>The Lord did not send the crowds away with nothing. An example of
God’s miraculous care for people.</p>
<p>The miracle of feeding the crowd of thousands with a few loaves and
fishes far surpasses the miracle of the prophet Elisha and shows the
divine dignity of Jesus.</p>
<p>The miracle also shows in a peculiar way that God is both economical
and generous. He is economical because He fed the people with a small
amount of the initial food, and generous because He fed them fully,
generously, and abundantly. God’s grace often works in a similar way -
God gives it generously, but at the same time to a certain extent.</p>
<p>To the Saint Fathers of the 6 Ecumenical Councils:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews XIII,
7-16; John XVII, 1-13) </reading><br>

<p>For readings from the Gospel, see here:

<p>In general, the readings are devoted to the theme of fathers and
shepherds, which is why they correspond to the memory of the saints and
events.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
