it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

the latter — once or twice a month (in Ukrainian), to keep the text version current and up to date.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Timothy V, 22-VI, 11) </reading><br>
1 Timothy VI, 1 — &#39;ὑπὸ ζυγὸν&#39; — &#39;hypo zygon&#39; - <q>under a yoke</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the accusative and indicates here that it is spoken about being in the state of dependence, slavery.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI, 4 — &#39;ἐξ ὧν&#39; - &#39;ex hon&#39; - <q>from which</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;ho&#39; indicates origin and true cause.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI, 7 — &#39;εἰς τὸν κόσμον&#39; - &#39;eis ton kosmon&#39; - <q>into (this) world</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI, 9 — &#39;εἰς πειρασμὸν καὶ παγίδα καὶ ἐπιθυμίας πολλὰς ἀνοήτους καὶ βλαβερά&#39; - &#39;eis peirasmon kai pagida kai epithymias pollas anoetous kai blabera&#39; - <q>into temptation, and a snare, and many (various) unreasonable and harmful lusts</q>. Where to. It is necessary to remember that ways to become rich then were fewer, but trials on the path were similar, as now. &#39;εἰς ὄλεθρον καὶ ἀπώλειαν&#39; - &#39;eis olethron kai apoleian&#39; - <q>into ruin and destruction; for ruin and destruction</q>. Where to and for what, into what state.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI, 10 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς πίστεως&#39; - &#39;apo tes pisteos&#39; - <q>from the faith</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that they fell away completely, that is, lost it entirely.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul gives various instructions and advice. In particular the advice to use a little wine corresponds to the medicine of that time (by <q>wine</q> can be understood fresh grape juice, since at that time intoxicating wine was considered bad).
</p>
<p>
First he instructs to relate considerately and thoughtfully to ordination (the Sacrament of Priesthood), if a bishop ordains someone, knowing that that person sins and does not correct themselves, is rooted in evil, then becomes a participant in the sins of that person.
</p>
<p>
Then he says that there are evident and secret sins, similarly also good works.
</p>
<p>
Regarding slaves he tells them to serve conscientiously. I wrote regarding corresponding places in the Epistles to the Corinthians, Ephesians and Colossians earlier. See at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/23072025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/23072025.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/09122025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/09122025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Regarding Christian masters — it is meant that if slaves often feared non-believers, then Christians — no, but could become careless. From this the Apostle Paul warns.
</p>
<p>
Further he warns against proud false teachers and teaches to guard what was handed down from Christ through the apostles.
</p>
<p>
He teaches to be satisfied with those material goods which we have when they are sufficient for needs.
</p>
<p>
He warns against attachment and desire for money for enrichment.
</p>
<p>
And again he reminds about eternal life and the necessity to place hope on (put in the centre of life) God.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XVIII, 15-17, 26-30) </reading><br>
Luke XVIII, 17 — &#39;εἰς αὐτήν&#39; — &#39;eis auten&#39; - <q>into it</q>. Where to. That is, will not be able to live already now according to God&#39;s will completely, fully.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 27 — &#39;παρὰ ἀνθρώποις&#39; — &#39;para anthropois&#39; - <q>in the vicinity of people</q>. &#39;παρὰ τῷ θεῷ&#39; - &#39;para to theo&#39; - <q>in the vicinity of God</q>. The prepositions &#39;para&#39; are here with the dative case. Here the Lord indicates that it is possible to distinguish life according to God&#39;s will as that which concerns closeness of God, from when a person does not live according to God&#39;s will — like (many) people. More about what in the Gospels is often called to enter the Kingdom of Heaven / God, see at the links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 30 — &#39;ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ&#39; — &#39;en to kairo touto&#39; - <q>in this time</q>. &#39;ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ&#39; - &#39;en to aioni to erkhomeno&#39; - <q>in the coming age; in the future age</q>. That is in the Kingdom of God. When.

</p>
<p>
Regarding the reward to the faithful and Peter&#39;s question — it is spoken about decisiveness which is necessary so that to live according to God&#39;s will, also about self-sacrifice, when a person is ready to change for the glory of God, overcoming various attachments. Marriage must be kept, and parents honoured, loved, also children must be loved and cared for, and here it is spoken about that a person for the sake of God&#39;s Kingdom is ready not to seek marriage, to continue to fulfil God&#39;s will even if parents are against, not to try to <q>appease</q> children by renouncing faith for the sake of some <q>innovations</q> and so on — situations of such kind can be many, and a faithful person will be able to be faithful by God&#39;s mercy, but for this are needed both decisiveness and self-sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to remember that Peter was married. His wife he did not leave, but for the sake of apostleship devoted his time and life to the ministry of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Christ&#39;s words should be perceived as encouragement to all the faithful in similar situations — after all this is a promise of salvation and God&#39;s blessing.
