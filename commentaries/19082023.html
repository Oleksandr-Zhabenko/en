<p>2 Peter I, 11, 14, 16  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 13  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used for
emphasis.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 15  &ndash; ‘εμην’  &ndash; ‘emen’  &ndash; ‘my’.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 18  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 19  &ndash; ‘προσεχοντες’  &ndash; ‘prosekhontes’  &ndash; ‘considering;
devoting oneself; having in addition or besides’. ‘εως ου ημερα’  &ndash; ‘eos
ou emera’  &ndash; ‘until this day’  &ndash; here the Day of the Second Coming of
Christ is meant, that is, until Christ comes again. The prophecies are
valid until the Second Coming, both those that have been fulfilled and
those that are to be fulfilled.</p>
<p><q>Entering the Kingdom of God</q> also refers to the ability to
consciously live in accordance with God’s will and purpose now, even
before the Kingdom of God comes, but also to the Kingdom of God itself
after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><q>My present dwelling place</q> (in the original, a word that is related
to the word <q>tabernacle</q>, <q>tent</q>, and also recalls both the Old
Testament tabernacle and the Transfiguration, which is described below)
is Peter’s body before his death.</p>
<p>Christ had revealed to Peter that he would soon pass away to be with
the Lord, which Peter recalls here.</p>
<p>Peter saw one of the tasks of his ministry as establishing others in
faith and virtue (cf. Luke XXII:32; John XXI:15-25), and he continues to
do so even after his bodily death.</p>
<p>He then refers to the Transfiguration of the Lord, which he himself
personally witnessed and participated in. Many Gentiles’ myths and
legends contain artistic speculations, the fantasy of the authors, often
quite inventive, but the apostles were witnesses of Christ.</p>
<p>And here Peter testifies to the Transfiguration, the feast of which
is celebrated today.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the reading was mentioned above, the richness of
meanings in a complex metaphor with several components is very great, so
it is difficult to give a good translation. Prophetic words are both
something to <q>have in addition</q> and it is good to entrust oneself to God
believing in them, and they are also worth considering and paying
attention to. The significance of the Old Testament prophecies for the
establishment of the faith is great.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XVII, 1-9) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XVII, 1  &ndash; ‘ημερας’  &ndash; ‘emeras’ -
‘days’.</p>
<p>Matthew XVII, 2  &ndash; ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before, in the face
of’.</p>
<p>Matthew XVII, 4  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’. ‘σκηνας’  &ndash; ‘skenas’ -
‘tents’ (see the parallel with the reading above).</p>
<p>The reading is about the Transfiguration of our Lord God and Saviour
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As faithful people understand it, this manifestation was intended to
strengthen the faith of the apostles when they would see Christ
suffering on the cross, at the time of His Passion, Death and
Resurrection. The prohibition to tell may have been caused by the fact
that the disciples still did not understand the upcoming events with
Jesus, although He had already told them about them, so in order not to
spread the wrong vision of the event, Jesus forbade them to tell.</p>
<p>We also see here the appearance of the Trinity  &ndash; the Son was
transfigured, the Father testified with His voice, and the Holy Spirit
appeared in the image of a light-bearing cloud. There is a parallel with
the appearance of the Trinity at the time of Jesus’ Baptism in the
Jordan.</p>
<p>In the description of the event, we can see a clear manifestation of
the human spirit (as I wrote about earlier). The human spirit manifests
itself most vividly in three areas  &ndash; the desire for God (thirst and
hunger for righteousness  &ndash; one way to put it in other words), the fear
of God and conscience (directly related to the ability to recognise good
and evil) (see this in Ukrainian at
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc---">https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc---</a><br>
).</p>
<p>Here we see high degrees of manifestation of all three at the same
time  &ndash; <q>It is good for us to be here…</q> and the desire to stay is the
desire of God; the disciples’ great fear is the manifestation of the
fear of God (about which more is written at
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a><br>
or in the Dutch:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/nl/dialoog.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/nl/dialoog.html</a><br>
); and <q>It is good for us to be here…</q> is also a manifestation of
conscience, which testifies that it is good to see the light of the
Transfiguration, the light of God.</p>
<p>So, the Lord did show His glory to the disciples to the extent that
they could contain it  &ndash; to the full extent for the spirit, the vision
with the bodily eyes, and all together  &ndash; the meaning for the souls.</p>
<p>There were also discussions about what the light of Tabor was like in
the XIII century, and the doctrine of this light was formulated by Saint
Gregory Palamas. Without going into details, I will say that the light
of Tabor is Divine energy, the operation of God outside of His own
nature, the operation in creation, grace, which is uncreated, eternal.
We can say that it is God Himself (though not in Himself, but in
creation) revealing and manifesting Himself.</p>
<p>As I wrote earlier, the word <q>grace</q> in Scripture can be used in
other meanings (see, in particular, the following link:
