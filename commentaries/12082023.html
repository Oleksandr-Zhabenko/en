<p><reading>(Romans XV, 30-33) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans XV, 30  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).
‘συναγωνισασθαι’  &ndash; ‘synagonisasthai’  &ndash; ‘participate in the competition,
help, fight on the same side together’. ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (for)
‘me’.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whereas the previous letter was more about deeds, this
one is about prayer. Paul asks for prayer in common with him.</p>
<p>I note that it is clear here that a common prayer can be one that is
done by people who are at a great distance. Distance is not an obstacle
to common prayer, just as it is not an obstacle when people gathered in
one place are nevertheless separated by a small distance from each
other. Nevertheless, such sharing in prayer at a distance is not
equivalent to praying together in one place. This is especially true in
the age of technology-driven broadcasts.</p>
<p>For the most shared prayer, it is not only the common place of prayer
that is important, but also the personal relationships that are possible
only in the direct presence of the participants. Long distances place
certain limitations on the place and relationships, which does not harm
the sharing of prayer, but is not equal to praying together in one
place.</p>
<p><q>Deliverance from the unfaithful</q>  &ndash; that is, that the Lord would
deliver from the persecutions by non-Christians, so that everything
would be calm.</p>
<p><q>acceptable to the saints</q>  &ndash; that is, to faithful Christians, was
well received by them.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XVII, 24  &ndash; XVIII, 4) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XVII, 27  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’ -
‘Me’.</p>
<p>For a part of the reading from chapter XVIII, see the link:

<p>I wrote about the tax earlier, an important place for politics. I
quote a slightly edited text: ” This passage about the tax on the temple
is found only in Matthew. Peter, as a law-abiding Galilean, is certain,
that Christ will pay a tax on the temple, as He had done in the past. So
he answers <q>Yes</q> in advance. Jesus’ question is addressed to Peter, and
the dialogue is also important for politics. This is the only place
where Christ teaches that there is something to change in politics and
state institutions. The New Testament texts without it might give the
impression that the Lord was not interested in direct reforms in the
political and financial spheres of the state. But, as we can see, He was
interested. Only with Peter does He talk about it  &ndash; to the one, who was
certainly interested in matters of power. We can draw a conclusion from
everything, that the Lord advises Christians to engage in reforms who
are really interested in this area, but also allows them to be
conservative. Christ has broad political views, but He is wise, and
oriented towards freedom. One must also be guided by the public and
personal good. ”</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
