it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah VI, 1-12) </reading><br>
Isaiah VI, 4 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς’ - ‘apo tes phones’ - ‘from the voice’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the voice came out to be heard, to shake the building.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah VI, 5 &mdash; ‘ἐν μέσῳ’ - ‘en meso’ - ‘in the midst’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah VI, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ χειρὶ’ - ‘en te kheiri’ - ‘in the hand’. ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου’ - ‘apo tou thysiasteriou’ - ‘from the altar’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the coals were completely taken from the altar to touch the prophet's lips.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah VI, 11 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τὸ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι’ - ‘para to me katoikeisthai’ - ‘to the proximity of [that state so] that they will be uninhabited'. That is, close to a state of almost complete desolation. ‘παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἀνθρώπους’ - ‘para to me einai anthropous’ - ‘to the proximity of being without people’. Similar to the previous one. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the accusative case and indicates that it refers to the state of being ‘almost completely&hellip;’.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs VI, 3-20) </reading><br>
Proverbs VI, 3 &mdash; ‘εἰς χεῖρας κακῶν’ - ‘eis kheiras kakon’ - ‘into evil hands’. That is, into a bad situation.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs VI, 5 &mdash; ‘ἐκ βρόχων’ - ‘ek brokhon’ - ‘out of the snare; from the snare'. ‘ἐκ παγίδος’ - ‘ek pagidos’ - ‘out of the snare; from the snare'. The preposition ‘ek’ here in both cases indicates where one needs to escape from (i.e. what the situation actually means).
</p>
<p>
Proverbs VI, 7 &mdash; ‘μηδὲ ὑπὸ δεσπότην ὢν’ - ‘mede hypo despoten on’ - ‘and nor under a ruler (is)’. That is, there is no one to use and take care of the land, no rightful owner. The preposition ‘hypo’ is here with an accusative case and indicates that the land is (not) under a rightful owner.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs VI, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἀμήτῳ’ - ‘en to ameto’ - ‘in the harvest’. 
</p>
<p>
Proverbs VI, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ὕπνου’ - ‘ex hypnou’ - ‘from sleep; from a dream’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the state from which one is to wake up. 
</p>
<p>
Proverbs VI, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ’ - ‘en panti kairo’ - ‘at all times; at every season’. That is, always, at every opportunity.
