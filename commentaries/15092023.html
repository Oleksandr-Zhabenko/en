<p>(Galatians IV, 8-21) Galatians IV:10 - ‘ημερας’ - ‘emeras’ - ‘days’
((at the) days).</p>
<p>Paul reminds the Galatians of their state before and at the beginning
of their conversion, comparing it with the state they could have been
tempted to fall into at that time.</p>
<p>He also recalls their sincerity in receiving Christ, as well as Paul
himself, to whom they had placed their complete trust and even entrusted
themselves.</p>
<p>The mention of Paul’s weakness is not clear - perhaps Paul is
referring to the same thing as in 2 Corinthians XII, or perhaps to some
kind of eye disease (further words about the eyes may indicate this),
but the latter has no confirmation from known sources.</p>
<p>Paul compares the recognition of the need to fulfil the ceremonial
component of the Mosaic Law to ministering to the elements of the world
(the heavenly elements, the primary elements of the world). Ministry to
these elements was common among the Gentiles in various forms, and the
Galatian Christians were Gentiles before their conversion.</p>
<p>It should be understood that the comparison is not literal (the
observance of the ceremonial component of the Mosaic Law is not
idolatry, worship of the creation instead of the Creator), but means
that, like the ministry to the elements, it <q>has the appearance of
wisdom</q> but has no saving power. If the focus of spiritual life is on
this, then a person simply acts unreasonably and wrongly, which can
really harm their salvation, not only their own, but also that of other
people.</p>
<p>(Mark VI, 45-53) Mark VI, 45 - ‘εμβηναι’ - ‘embenai’ - ‘to get into’
(a boat).</p>
<p>Mark VI, 50 - ‘ειμι’ - ‘eimi’ - (I) ‘am’. It is used for
emphasis.</p>
<p>For a similar passage in Matthew (Matthew XIV, 22-34), see the
following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="06082023.html">06082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>An even more similar passage is found in John (John VI, 16-21), see
the following link (briefly):
<br><a class="link2" href="29042023.html">29042023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The translation of <q>ghost</q> (Mark VI, 49) is not a good one, as it
might suggest that the apostles actually believed in ghosts. Instead,
the word used in the original means <q>vision, dream, apparition, ghost,
something unreal</q> meaning that the apostles apparently thought they were
seeing… a mirage, or a vision, something unreal. Instead, it was Jesus
Himself.</p>
