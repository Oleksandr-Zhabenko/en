<p><reading>(Hebrews IV, 14  &ndash; V, 6) </reading>
</p>
<p>Hebrews IV, 16  &ndash; παρρησιας — which means
<q>freedom, openness, especially in speech; confidence, courage,
frankness, which comes from a combination of words that literally
means</q>all-out-spokenness.”</p>
<p>Hebrews V, 1  &ndash; <q>from (from among as a source of origin) men above (or
on behalf of) men is appointed in things relating to God.</q></p>
<p>Hebrews V, 6  &ndash; <q>according to the order (rank, regular arrangement,
appointed succession, position) of Melchizedek</q>  &ndash; Melchizedek is the
king of peace (some believe, of Jerusalem) and literally <q>the king of
righteousness</q> according to the book of Genesis appeared to Abraham
after the latter’s victory over Sodom and Gomorrah princes and blessed
him with the name of God. Abraham gave him a tenth of the booty as to a
(high) priest.</p>
<p>In fact, multi-meaningful words that mean that Christ is the sense of
the priesthood as such.</p>
<p>And all together — that He is the Son of God and the perfect High
Priest.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark VIII, 34  &ndash; IX, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark VIII, 34  &ndash; <q>let him take</q>  &ndash; more
precisely literally  &ndash; <q>let him take up (raise, lift up)</q>.</p>
<p>An important detail that some translations omit (perhaps in the hope
that it will be clear anyway). The cross must be <q>lifted up</q>, i.e. not
simply <q>accepted as one’s own</q>, but made higher than oneself, i.e. it is
about the height of work, feat, and about <q>the banner of victory</q>, and
about ministering. The cross must not only be raised up, it must also
raise a person behind it. But if you understand the cross only as
difficulties <q>without Jesus Christ, without the Crucified One</q>, then
difficulties do not lift a person. Only with faith in Christ can one
truly understand the cross as something that lifts a person up.</p>
<p>Mark VIII, 35-36  &ndash; <q>soul</q> (ψυχη)  &ndash; also, as is known in Scripture,
synonymous with life.</p>
<p><q>profit, benefit</q> — <q>help, advantage, property, gain</q>. <q>the whole
world</q> means <q>the whole, completely, entirely</q> in different
meanings.</p>
<p>Mark VIII, 37 — <q>in exchange</q> — more precisely <q>in exchange, as a
replacement, for exchange for, as the cost of purchase, redemption</q> —
that is, a person does not have the ability in one way or another to
<q>exchange</q> <q>the world for a soul</q>, there is no way to <q>redeem the soul
with the world</q>, <q>to save the soul with the world</q>. Such is the nature
of things.</p>
<p>The words of Mark IX, 1  &ndash; refer directly to the Transfiguration of
the Lord that follows them, which, according to the Gospels, took place
some time before the Passion of Jesus, why chronologically it would be
appropriate to celebrate this holiday in Great Lent, but also in a
broader sense  &ndash; according to the recognition of Christ, the Lord often
favors to give glory to the person himself / herself through his / her
participation in the Kingdom of God right now.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
