it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<reading>(1 Corinthians IV, 1-5) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians IV, 2 — 'ἐν τοῖς οἰκονόμοις' - 'en tois oikonomois' - <q>in stewards</q>. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians IV, 3 — 'εἰς ἐλάχιστόν' - 'eis elakhiston' - <q>to the least</q>. That is, becomes least significant, loses significance up to almost none. 'ὑφ' ὑμῶν' - 'hyph hymon' - <q>by you</q>. 'ὑπὸ ἀνθρωπίνης' - 'hypo anthropiness' - <q>by human day</q> (that is by human measures, since judgment was to take place during the day). The preposition 'hypo' in both places with genitive case and indicates the passive voice <q>to be assessed; to be examined (for determining value, innocence or truth); to be judged</q>. The polysemantic word in passive voice indicates that apostle Paul generally gives all such things to God.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians IV, 4 — 'ἐν τούτῳ' - 'en touto' - <q>in this; by this</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, though they are different.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians IV, 5 — 'ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ' — 'apo tou theou' - <q>from God</q>. The preposition 'apo' emphasises that this praise will be a gift of God, and also shows how vividly God will rejoice in people in what He will praise, similarly as a sincere open and benevolent person openly and expressively reacts to good in friends.
