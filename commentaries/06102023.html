<p><reading>(Ephesians VI, 18-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of what is said at the link
below and the conclusion of Ephesians:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0HBJ4bChqXFT9i9ZB8ahDQ36w1nvkvtJKyMhmnKwKsebHfh593bMs1jrDwi9pKXSdl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 18  &ndash; ‘δια πασης προσευχης και δεησεως προσευχομενοι’ -
‘dia pases proseukhes kai deeseos proseukhomenoi’  &ndash; ‘through (as a means
or mode of action) all high prayer (lifted up) and (diligent)
supplication (highly) pray (’lift up your prayers’)<q>.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 19  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (for, concerning) ‘me’. ‘εν
παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘en parresia’  &ndash; ‘in boldness, confidence, openness,
all-out-well-spokenness, freely’.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 20  &ndash; ‘παρρησιασωμαι’  &ndash; ‘parresissomai’  &ndash; ‘to proclaim
boldly; to speak boldly, freely, openly, confidently’.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 21  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; (of) ‘me’.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 22, 24  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ ((of) us), ours).
‘παρακαλεση’  &ndash; ‘parakalese’  &ndash; (to) ‘comfort’. ‘εν αφθαρσια’  &ndash; ‘en
aphtharsia’  &ndash; ‘undamaged, indestructible, incorruptible, without change
for the worse (but with change for the better)’.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul asks for prayers for the faithful (called <q>saints</q> -
by God’s grace, but not necessarily personally saints), and especially
for himself, so that the Lord may strengthen him in his preaching and
apostolic work.</p>
<p>The mention of chains is thought to refer to the fact that Paul was
often imprisoned for his preaching and apostolic work, and may have been
imprisoned at the time of writing (although this is not necessarily the
case, it is more likely to refer to general events in his life that were
repeated).</p>
<p>He writes about his co-worker, the apostle Tychicus, and his mission.
He was to help build up the church in Ephesus (and in Asia Minor in
general, where he came from), and to comfort the faithful (see

<p>The Epistle concludes with final greetings, wishes and blessings.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VII, 31-35) </reading>
</p>
<p>Continuation of yesterday’s reading, which is
referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="05102023.html">05102023.html</a></p>
<p>I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XI, 16-20)
here:
<br><a class="link2" href="27062023.html">27062023.html</a></p>
<p>To the Apostle Thomas: (1 Corinthians IV, 9-16; John XX, 19-31) 1
Corinthians IV, 9  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IV, 10  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘μωροι’  &ndash; ‘moroi’ -
‘foolish’  &ndash; from ‘μωρος’  &ndash; ‘moros’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IV, 13  &ndash; ‘παρακαλουμεν’  &ndash; ‘parakaloumen’  &ndash; ‘we pray, we
ask (God)’ (here, in general, the word is polysemous).</p>
<p>1 Corinthians IV, 16  &ndash; ‘παρακαλω’  &ndash; ‘parakalo’  &ndash; ‘I ask’ (here, in
general, the word is polysemous).</p>
<p>The Apostle’s reading about the apostolic work. The apostles work as
pioneers, paving the way, and then it is much easier for the faithful to
follow them. And as pioneers, it is always more difficult for apostles.
But the Lord strengthens them.</p>
<p>The reading from the Gospel, in which Thomas is convinced of the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is well written at the following link:
