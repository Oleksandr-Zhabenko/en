it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

Congratulations on the Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos!
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews VII, 18-25) </reading><br>
Hebrews VII, 19 — &#39;ἐτελείωσεν&#39; — &#39;eteleiosen&#39; - <q>made complete, fully-ended</q>. The Law was an accomplishing in that it allowed to know what is sin and what is righteousness, more deeply and better, but it could not make the doers perfect, could not likewise save them. Instead salvific and perfect is the Hope — Christ, about Whom here implicitly, and further explicitly it is spoken.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VII, 21, 24 — &#39;εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα&#39; - &#39;eis ton aiona&#39; - <q>for ever</q>. That is <q>with expansion further into the ages</q>, that is with duration and expansion further and further into different times and into eternity.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VII, 25 — &#39;εἰς τὸ παντελὲς&#39; - &#39;eis to panteles&#39; - <q>for complete completion; into complete completion</q>. That is it is meant <q>completely, uttermost to save</q>. The salvation, granted by Christ, is final, completely finished, full. &#39;εἰς τὸ ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;eis to entynkganein hyper auton&#39; - <q>for intercession for them</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.  
</p>
<p>
An oath in God means something final and unchangeable, therefore, the High Priesthood of Jesus Christ is eternal and unchangeable.
</p>
<p>
In Scripture there are no places where God would regret His oath (promise), but such regret happens in people through their sinfulness and imperfection. Here there is obvious anthropomorphism regarding the description of God.
</p>
<p>
It is also necessary to say that in the history of Noah it is said that <q>God regretted</q> that He created people through the growth of their lawlessness, therefore He brought the flood upon the earth. Here again is typical for Old Testament people the non-distinguishing of God&#39;s permission and God&#39;s will — God regrets actually not for the creation of people (otherwise He would not create anyone, knowing everything beforehand), but regretted, had mercy on future generations, which could have been corrupted similarly to Noah&#39;s contemporaries, if they had continued to exist as a civilisation further, and there had been no flood. More about that I wrote at the time of commenting on the history of the flood and the salvation of Noah and his family. See also:<br>

Further also Paul emphasises the eternity of Jesus Christ as the Living High Priest for ever and Intercessor. See also more about that at the link:<br>

<reading>(Luke XXI, 37-XXII, 8 ) </reading><br>
Luke XXI, 37, 38 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ&#39; — &#39;en to hiero&#39; - <q>in the temple</q>. &#39;εἰς τὸ ὄρος&#39; - &#39;eis to oros&#39; - <q>to the mountain</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 3 — &#39;εἰς Ἰούδαν&#39; — &#39;eis Ioudan&#39; - <q>into Judas</q>. &#39;ἐκ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ τῶν δώδεκα&#39; - &#39;ek tou arithmou ton dodeka&#39; - <q>from the number of the twelve</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates the choice among a group of people.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXII, 7 — &#39;ἐν ᾗ&#39; — &#39;en he&#39; - <q>in which</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Luke briefly gives the summary of events with Judas Iscariot — <q>satan entered into him</q>, and he decided to betray Jesus to the Jewish elders. Other evangelists give more details, in particular the motives of Judas.<br>

<p>
The Lord warns us against impenitence, because in particular through it the evil one can have access to a person, even if they have a high calling, and the Lord showed great care to them.

Also briefly about the preparation for Passover by Jesus and the disciples.
