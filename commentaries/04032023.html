<p><reading>(Hebrews I, 1-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>This week we read about the creation of the world,
but on Saturday we logically read about the relationship between the
first creatures (angels) and the Son of God, generally about
Himself.</p>
<p>Verse 1 sounds literally <q>in many parts and in many ways (paths)…</q> -
that is, here we also see that the writings of the prophets (and in
particular Moses) are <q>many</q>-<q>partial</q>, that is, this confirms that what
is written is multi-layered and cannot be unified, reduced to <q>one size
fits all</q>.</p>
<p>Hebrews I, 3  &ndash; literally <q>The radiance (spreading) of the glory and
character (a word derived from the ‘(en)graver’, which means an exact
imprint, image) of His (Father’s) hypostasis</q> (here it is not used in
the modern theological sense, but the theological term itself is taken
from this verse, which already speaks of its fundamentality). It is
about explaining the pre-eternity and uncreatedness of the Son of God,
since God is always in glory, and the exact copy has the same qualities
and features as the original. There is nothing in nature to compare
with, but one can have a certain idea that the perfect eternal Image of
the Father (the Son) is the same as the Father in everything, except
only that which actually distinguishes the Son from the Father.</p>
<p>And what distinguishes it is the hypostatic (which only He has)
property of being born from the Father.</p>
<p>And then the quotations from the Old Testament clearly show that the
Son of God is God, the Lord, the incomparably Supreme of all creation
and the Creator. At the same time, the words about His <q>acceptance</q> of
glory point to the Incarnation of the Son of God (remember, for example,
Christmas and Ascension).</p>
<p>And in the Kingdom of God, when <q>heaven and earth pass away</q> in their
present state, but the Son of God, Jesus Christ, will remain the
same.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark II, 23  &ndash; III, 5) </reading>
</p>

<p><q>The Sabbath arose because of (for the reason, for) man, not man
because of (for the reason, for) the Sabbath.</q> <q>You can do good deeds
even on the Sabbath,</q> is the summary of the thought from another place.
These words can be further generalized  &ndash; the Sabbath is a sign of a
certain orderliness, readiness (of the week, just like as of the
creation of the world was the seventh day), completion, but if something
looks already completed, determined, ordered, but it prevents us from
doing true good, fulfilling God’s will, to save people, then order
should not <q>stand above</q> good, above man, after all.</p>
<p>For this, there is an opportunity to do good without changing the
order, but there is also an opportunity to change the order, if it is
established by man and not by God. The commandment was given by God,
therefore Christ does not cancel it (because it is His), but more often
we are talking about human decrees, and they can and sometimes must be
changed in order to do good.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
