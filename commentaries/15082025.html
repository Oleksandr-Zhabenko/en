<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Philippians II, 6 — 'ἐν μορφῇ θεοῦ ὑπάρχων' - 'en morphe theou hyparkhon' - in the form, shape, image, appearance of God existing, possessing; (as) the form, shape, image, appearance of God existing, possessing. Difficult to translate accurately, most likely existing in form. Jesus Christ is the form of God (that is, of God the Father). The word 'μορφή', which is used here, does not indicate how the Son exists, how He is born of the Father, but indicates that His existence is in no way essentially inferior to the existence of the Father, and this means that He is equally God as the Father (and the Holy Spirit also). The Son exists, lives, acts similarly to the Father and the Spirit, the Son is the image of the Father. The entire reading from the Apostle points to the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah XLV (especially Isaiah XLV, 21-25). οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἶναι ἴσα θεῷ' - 'oukh harpagmon hegesato to einai isa theo' - did not think with great desire to be equal to God (that is, the Father). Here a comparison with Lucifer, who became the devil, is possible — the latter precisely thought with great desire to be equal to the Father. Christ, being God (unlike the angel Lucifer), did not seek elevation (as Lucifer sought), but showed humility. There is also here a parallel with the Mother of God, Whose feast is today, because She also at the time of decision and always showed humility, calling Herself the handmaid (servant) of God. It should be said that Luke, the author of the Gospel and the book of Acts of the holy apostles, my beloved saint, was a close friend of both the Mother of God and the Apostle Paul.

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
To the Mother of God:<br>
<reading>(Philippians II, 5-11) </reading><br>
Philippians II, 5 — 'ἐν ὑμῖν' - 'en hymin' - <q>in you</q>. Where, among whom, in whom. 'ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ' - 'en CHristo Iesou' - <q>in Christ Jesus</q>. The preposition 'en' here additionally indicates permanence — let them always be such.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 6 — 'ἐν μορφῇ θεοῦ ὑπάρχων' - 'en morphe theou hyparkhon' - <q>in the form, shape, image, appearance of God existing, possessing; (as) the form, shape, image, appearance of God existing, possessing</q>. Difficult to translate accurately, most likely <q>existing in form</q>. Jesus Christ is the form of God (that is, of God the Father). The word 'μορφή', which is used here, does not indicate how the Son exists, how He is born of the Father, but indicates that His existence is in no way essentially inferior to the existence of the Father, and this means that He is equally God as the Father (and the Holy Spirit also). The Son exists, lives, acts similarly to the Father and the Spirit, <q>the Son is the image of the Father</q>. The entire reading from the Apostle points to the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah XLV (especially Isaiah XLV, 21-25). 'οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἶναι ἴσα θεῷ' - 'oukh harpagmon hegesato to einai isa theo' - <q>did not think with great desire to be equal to God (that is, the Father)</q>. Here a comparison with Lucifer, who became the devil, is possible — the latter precisely <q>thought with great desire to be equal to the Father</q>. Christ, being God (unlike the angel Lucifer), did not seek elevation (as Lucifer sought), but showed humility. There is also here a parallel with the Mother of God, Whose feast is today, because She also at the time of decision and always showed humility, calling Herself <q>the handmaid (servant) of God</q>. It should be said that Luke, the author of the Gospel and the book of Acts of the holy apostles, my beloved saint, was a close friend of both the Mother of God and the Apostle Paul.<br>

</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 7 — 'μορφὴν δούλου' - 'morphe doulou' - <q>the form, likeness, image of a servant, slave</q>. See above. 'ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων γενόμενος' - 'en omoiomati anthropon genomenos' - <q>in the likeness (to) people becoming, being born; (as; unto) the likeness of people becoming, being born</q>. This concerns the Incarnation of the Son of God <q>from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary</q>.<br>
 <br>
Philippians II, 9 — 'ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὄνομα' - 'hyper pan onoma' - <q>above every name</q>. The preposition 'hyper' here with the accusative, this means that it is translated precisely as <q>above, higher than</q>.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 10 — 'ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ' - 'en to onomati Iesou' - <q>in the name of Jesus; by the name of Jesus</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, and the second conveys a deeper meaning, on which I will dwell a little. Recognising Jesus as Lord, the faithful witness that His name Jesus — <q>the Lord is salvation</q> is real, true, effective and the like. This salvation is the recognition that the Lord is the Saviour, that the Lord has saved the person.
</p>
<p>
Philippians II, 11 — 'εἰς δόξαν θεοῦ πατρός' - 'eis doxan theou patros' - <q>to the glory of God the Father; for the glory of God the Father</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates also here additionally to the meaning concerning Jesus Himself — His Resurrection, Ascension, Second Glorious Coming and the Kingdom of God — also the movement of humanity in Christ — to the glory of the Father, to glorification in salvation. <q>So that every creature might confess, recognise, and therefore feel salvation in the Lord</q>. This does not mean that all creatures will be saved, but it means that all creatures will feel and manifest, recognise the fruits of the saving Sacrifice of Jesus.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke X, 38-42; XI, 27-28 ) </reading><br>
Luke X, 38 — 'ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι' - 'en to poreuesthai' - <q>in travelling; while travelling</q>. When. 'εἰς κώμην' - 'eis komen' - <q>to a village</q>. Where to. 'εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν' - 'eis ten oikian' - <q>into the house</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke XI, 27 — 'ἐν τῷ λέγειν' - 'en to legein' - <q>in speaking; when He was speaking</q>. When. 'ἐκ τοῦ ὄχλου' - 'ek tou okhlou' - <q>from the crowd; out of the crowd</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here that this woman is a representative of the crowd, that is, many people shared (share and will share) her voiced opinion.
</p>
<p>
Luke XI, 28 — 'μενοῦν' - 'menoun' - <q>rather; more precisely</q>. Jesus did not deny the words of <q>the person from the crowd</q> (an unknown woman), but significantly clarified their meaning. That is, this is a clarification, expansion of the initial meaning. All people are called to fulfil God's will, similarly as the Mother of God fulfils it.
</p>
<p>
Reading on feasts in honour of the Mother of God. Jesus's words about Mary point to the virtues of the Mother of God and Her dignity.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, it is not superfluous to remind that the Lord does not reject or devalue Martha's work, but wants to highlight the goal and emphasise the meaning of His communication with them.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of His communication and friendship with them consisted primarily not in well-spent time, not in joy, not in common activities, work in particular, celebration, hospitality, but primarily — in the fact that this will teach the sisters to fulfil God's will similarly as Jesus Christ Himself fulfils it.
</p>
<p>
And this last is even more valuable than that opportunity to show human and friendly hospitality at that time. More valuable, because later precisely what they learned from Jesus they will be able to convey to others (in particular, judging by everything, there were no other witnesses to this situation besides the Three of them, and they told about it precisely they, the two sisters close to Jesus). And the Lord said more than once that He came not to be served, but to serve others Himself.
</p>
<p>
In this sense these words literally serve as one reading together with the following words about God's will already concerning the Mother of God.
</p>
