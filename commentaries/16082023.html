<p><reading>(2 Corinthians III, 4-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III,4  &ndash; ‘πεποιθησιν’ -
‘pepoithesin’  &ndash; ‘confidence, trust, boldness’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III,5  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III,6  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; (made) ‘us’.</p>
<p>A continuation of the previous readings, the last of which I wrote
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="15082023.html">15082023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul testifies that the ability to be Christ’s letter of trust is not
received by the apostles and all truly faithful Christians through
thoughts of themselves, but from God as the Source. This implies a
stronger statement that people’s true ability to be God’s servants is
not determined by their own assessment of whether they are, but by God
through His gift.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to compare the Old and New Testament ministries through
the image of <q>the letter and the Spirit</q>. By the Spirit, we must
understand the Holy Spirit, the Creator of life, the Lord, and the words
in the Creed is the quote from here.</p>
<p>The image will become clearer the more we think about the properties
of letters and the Holy Spirit. Letters are written, they are material,
and they are humans’, they are obvious and understandable to some, and
incomprehensible to others, and so on. But the Holy Spirit is
Life-giving (gives life, makes alive), He is immaterial to the highest
degree, spiritual, at the same time as He created matter with the Father
and the Son, He is the meaning of cognition of God (in particular
through Scripture), because this cognition is carried out through Him,
in Him and for Him (not only for Him alone, but also for the Father and
the Son), He also gives other gifts.</p>
<p>Since the letter is inanimate, the service of the letter does not
give life, does not save, and is intended to put to death sin without
having the full power to do so. In this regard, it is called the
<q>ministry of death</q>.</p>
<p>But the ministry of the letter, of the Old Testament, has its own
significance, which Paul does not elaborate on here, and which is
discussed in detail in his other epistles. It is worth recalling, but I
will not dwell on it here. To recall it, you can look at the following
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="19062023.html">19062023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul testifies that the service of the Spirit is far more glorious.
Indeed, the glory of God can be seen much more clearly in the New
Testament than in the Old, and this applies to almost everything.</p>
