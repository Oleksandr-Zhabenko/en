it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Thessalonians II, 20 &mdash; III, 8 ) </reading><br>
1 Thessalonians III, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν Ἀθήναις’ - ‘en Athenais’ - ‘in Athens’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ’ - ‘en to euangelio tou CHristou’ - ‘in the Gospel of Christ; in the Good News of Christ’. Both translations are possible. ‘εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι’ - ‘eis to sterixai’ - ‘to direct confidently; to establish’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. It is about establishing and directing in the faith.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν ταύταις’ - ‘en tais thlipsesin toutais’ - ‘in these same afflictions; in these tribulations; with these afflictions; with these tribulations’. All translations are possible, some emphasising that a person can waver in faith in difficulties due to weakness, and others that difficulties themselves can lead a person to weaken their faith. However, they should not. ‘εἰς τοῦτο’ - ‘eis touto’ - ‘for this’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. ‘Established’ so as not to ‘waver’ and not to fall. We need to understand the whole verse in context, with the previous and subsequent verses, not in isolation. The following verse 4 shows that the apostles spoke beforehand about the possibility of suffering, that is, they prepared the disciples to be ready if (when) it happens. Such readiness allows us to look at the situation realistically.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 5 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ γνῶναι’ - ‘eis to gnonai’ - ‘to know’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. ‘εἰς κενὸν’ - ‘eis kenon’ - ‘in vain’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 6 &mdash; ‘ἀφ’ ὑμῶν' - <q>aph hymon</q> - <q>from you</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates here that Timothy had left them completely at that time.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐν κυρίῳ’ - ‘en kyrio’ - ‘in the Lord; with the Lord’. Both translations are possible, although the first is much clearer and more commonly used.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XX, 27-44) </reading><br>
Luke XX, 33 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει’ - ‘en te anastasei’ - ‘in the resurrection’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XX, 35 &mdash; ‘ἀναστάσεως τῆς ἐκ νεκρῶν’ - ‘anastaseos tes ek nekron’ - ‘the resurrection, the one from the dead’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates here where the movement comes from - from death to life.
</p>
<p>
Luke XX, 42 &mdash; ‘ἐν βίβλῳ ψαλμῶν’ - ‘en biblo psalmon’ - ‘in the book of Psalms’. ‘ἐκ δεξιῶν’ - ‘ek dexion’ - ‘on the right (side)’. That is, on the ‘right hand’, a common expression.
