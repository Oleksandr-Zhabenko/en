it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

</p>
<p>
As the Great Lent is approaching, the readings from the New Testament are replaced with readings from the Old Testament, in order to urge people more towards repentance.
</p>
<p>
As it is spoken of several Ancient Greek (Koine) prepositions, the Old Testament readings will continue to be commented upon, examining the first complete translation into Ancient Greek — the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
At the 6th Hour:<br>
<reading>(Zechariah VIII, 7-17) </reading><br>
Zechariah VIII, 7 — &#39;ἀπὸ γῆς ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἀπὸ γῆς δυσμῶν&#39; — &#39;apo ges anatolon kai apo ges dysmon&#39; — <q>from the land of the rising of the sun and from the land of the setting of the sun; from the land of the east and from the land of the west</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that the Lord will gather His people from the east and the west, from everywhere, and they will leave those lands. This is a prophecy concerning a change of place, and in meaning — of the conditions of dwelling, that is, it means that the prophecy concerns the fact that the life of people in the Kingdom of God will be changed.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 8 — &#39;ἐν μέσῳ&#39; — &#39;en meso&#39; — <q>in the midst</q> (where). A common expression. &#39;εἰς λαόν&#39; - &#39;eis laon&#39; - <q>as a people; a people</q>. In meaning — the second variant. &#39;εἰς Θεόν&#39; - &#39;eis theon&#39; - <q>as God; God</q>. In meaning — the second variant. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates who or what God or the people will be, will become. &#39;ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ&#39; - &#39;en aletheia kai en dikaiosyne&#39; - <q>in truth and in righteousness; with truth and with righteousness</q>. Both translation variants are possible: the first indicates that all of this will take place truly and righteously, while the second — that truth and righteousness themselves will require this.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 9 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις&#39; — &#39;en tais hemerais tautais&#39; — <q>in these days; during these days</q>. When. &#39;ἐκ στόματος&#39; - &#39;ek stomatos&#39; - <q>from the mouth</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates from whence the words will sound forth. &#39;ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας&#39; - &#39;aph hes hemeras&#39; - <q>from that day</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following &#39;he&#39; indicates the starting point of the reckoning. &#39;ἀφ&#39; οὗ ᾠκοδόμηται&#39; - &#39;aph hou oikodometai&#39; - <q>from that which is to be built</q>. That is, after God&#39;s building, the divine economy, after salvation.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 10 — &#39;εἰς ὄνησιν&#39; — &#39;eis onesin&#39; — <q>for benefit; for good (in the sense of &#39;for the benefit&#39; in the broad meaning)</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose. &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς θλίψεως&#39; - &#39;apo tes thlipseos&#39; - <q>from affliction; from oppression</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that people were unable to avoid suffering.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 13 — &#39;ἐν κατάρᾳ&#39; — &#39;en katara&#39; — <q>in a curse</q>. That is, in many hardships and sufferings. &#39;ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν&#39; - &#39;en tois ethnesin&#39; - <q>among the nations; among the peoples</q>. &#39;ἐν εὐλογίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en eulogia&#39; - <q>in blessing</q>. &#39;ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;en tais chersin hymon&#39; - <q>in your hands</q>. That is, it is a question of strength in the hands of the faithful, of their strengthening.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῷ παροργίσαι με&#39; — &#39;en to parorgisai me&#39; — <q>in the provoking to anger near Me</q>. That is, people provoked God to anger at the very time when He was showing them closeness and mercy.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 15 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις&#39; — &#39;en tais hemerais tautais&#39; — <q>in these days</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 16 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς πύλαις ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;en tais pylais hymon&#39; — <q>in your gates (that is, cities, fortifications, organised places)</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 17 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;en tais kardiais hymon&#39; — <q>in your hearts</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
A supplement to the Wednesday readings. If in Joel fasting is a time of devout sorrow for salvation, then in Zechariah fasting is a time of joy for salvation. But in the Old Testament there was as yet no redemption by the Saviour, and therefore this is not yet the time of joy itself, but the time of awaiting it, and joy itself is the theme of the prophecy. Zechariah prophesies concerning that joy which fasting is to bestow, or more precisely which the Lord is to bestow in connection with it, in the times of the New Testament.
</p>
<p>
In the times of the New Testament both thoughts concerning fasting may be realised simultaneously, and therefore even the concept of <q>joyful mourning</q> arose in spiritual writings, which in the Greek language is even a single word. It sounds like an oxymoron, that is, a combination of opposite concepts in a single artistic image, which helps to express something important. Fasting is not called to give an advantage to (or to compensate for) certain individual and personal characteristics, such as, for example, making a lively person more calm, or enlivening a calm person, but it strives to fill life with feelings that are sincere and deep. These feelings are to lead a person towards God, towards oneself, towards other people. That is, fasting in truth changes that which harms this. Otherwise, on the emotional and sensory level, fasting will not be experienced and will not bear fruit in that sphere as it might.
</p>
<p>
Through the mouth of the prophet the Lord promises to save and <q>to be God for the people in truth and righteousness</q>, and <q>truth</q> may also signify <q>firmness, faithfulness</q>. That is, in fact to be a synonym of faith. Therefore to be God for the people <q>in faith, truth, firmness, certainty and righteousness</q>.
</p>
<p>
The prophet says <q>Be courageous, be strengthened!</q> twice. Why? In connection with God&#39;s blessing. This is important — one must be strengthened in all good, for God blesses it.
</p>
<p>
Concerning God&#39;s designs it is spoken with regard to God&#39;s permittance (with regard to sins) and with regard to God&#39;s will, His genuine desire concerning good. In the Old Testament these two in truth different attitudes of God are often depicted in the same manner as <q>God&#39;s design</q>. But God <q>did not create evil</q>, <q>does not think evil</q>, that is, it is a question of God&#39;s Providence, His All-knowing. God knows all things, but He contends against evil, while good He bestows, urges towards it and multiplies it. More on this theme is in the work at the link:<br>

<p>
At Vespers:<br>
<reading>(Zechariah VIII, 19-23) </reading><br>
Zechariah VIII, 19 — &#39;εἰς χαρὰν καὶ εὐφροσύνην καὶ εἰς ἑορτὰς ἀγαθάς&#39; — &#39;eis charan kai euphrosynen kai eis heortas agathas&#39; — <q>for joy, and glad well-being, and for good feasts; joy, and glad well-being, and good feasts</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates what fasting will become, into what it will be transformed. A parallel to the second Gospel Beatitude.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 21 — &#39;εἰς μίαν πόλιν&#39; — &#39;eis mian polin&#39; — <q>into one city</q>.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 22 — &#39;ἐν ῾Ιερουσαλήμ&#39; — &#39;en Hierousalem&#39; — <q>in Jerusalem</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 23 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις&#39; — &#39;en tais hemerais ekeinais&#39; — <q>in those days</q>. When. &#39;ἐκ πασῶν τῶν γλωσσῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν&#39; - &#39;ek pason ton glosson ton ethnon&#39; - <q>from all the tongues of the nations</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates from whence those people will come, also from whence the Lord will gather them.
</p>
<p>
Here one may also notice a very profound thought, that the person is conceived by God as truth, as peace, as the worth of trust, as certainty and faith. For the commandments say: <q>Thou shalt love the Lord… thou shalt love the person… Thou shalt love truth and peace...</q>. And therefore it is God&#39;s design that the person be truth and peace, for it has pleased God to reveal His truth to people and in the person — first and foremost in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, Who is the Prototype for every person, created in the image of God.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 19 — <q>Thus saith the Lord of Sabaoth: the fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth month shall be for the house of Juda for joy, and for gladness, and for good feasts, and ye shall rejoice. Therefore love truth and peace!</q>. The four mentions of fasts point in particular to the four many-day fasts in traditional Christianity (although the reckoning of months also differs).
</p>
<p>
The details of the words <q>for joy</q> — <q>for rejoicing, liveliness, especially at a meeting</q> (a word used not very frequently in the Old Testament), <q>for gladness</q> — <q>for joy in the broad sense</q> (a frequently used word concerning joy), <q>for good (in the broad sense, pleasant, fine) feasts</q> — <q>a good certain defined time, season, period, place or appointed meeting, which may also be used as a prior signal of something of the like</q>. <q>truth</q> — the same word as above, a synonym of faith and faithfulness, of trust and certainty. <q>peace</q> and <q>love</q> — words frequently used in Scripture.
</p>
<p>
Zechariah VIII, 23 — <q>We will go with thee, for we have heard that God is with you</q> — connected with the prophecy of Isaiah: <q>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive in the womb and shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call (they shall call) His name Emmanuel</q> (Isaiah VII, 14), <q>which being interpreted is: God with us</q> (Matthew I, 23).
