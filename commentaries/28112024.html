it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Thessalonians II, 9-14) </reading><br>
1 Thessalonians II, 9 &mdash; ‘εἰς ὑμᾶς’ - ‘eis hymas’ - ‘in you; towards you (in the sense of 'towards you; addressed to you')'. Both translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 12 (11) &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν’ - ‘eis to peripatein’ - ‘to walk; for walking’. The first translation is grammatically preferable, although the second is more literal. ‘εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ βασιλείαν’ - ‘eis ten heautou basileian’ - ‘into His Kingdom’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 13 &mdash; ‘παρ’ ἡμῶν' - <q>par hemon</q> - <q>from beside us</q>. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the following ‘he’ is here with the genitive case. This form is used when referring to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, as well as to the human nature of Jesus Christ. It implies that the apostles preached the Word of God in the Holy Spirit, bringing others into the Church, the Body of Christ. ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘en hymin’ - ‘in you’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians II, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ’ - ‘en te Ioudaia’ - ‘in Judea’. ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Christ Jesus’. ‘ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων συμφυλετῶν’ - ‘ypo ton idion symphyleton’ - ‘under your countrymen; through your countrymen’. ‘ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων’ - ‘ypo ton Ioudaion’ - ‘under the Jews; through the Jews’. The preposition ‘’ypo‘’ here is with the genitive case, in both cases the second translation is more likely.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XX, 9-18 ) </reading><br>
Luke XX, 10 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ καρποῦ’ - ‘apo tou karpou’ - ‘of the fruits’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that the owner was not so much interested in the fruits themselves as in the profit from them, in the growth of it. In the context and meaning of the parable, it is said that God wants rather that we become like Him, that we are deified, than that we do certain things; the reason for the creation of the world is more a desire for others to join the blissful life in God than a desire for others to fulfil something.
</p>
<p>
Luke XX, 17 &mdash; ‘εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας’ - ‘eis kephalen gonias’ - ‘at the head of the corner; the head of the corner’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates what the stone has turned into.
