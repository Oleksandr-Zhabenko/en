it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews VIII, 7-13) </reading><br>
Hebrews VIII, 9 — &#39;ἐν ἡμέρᾳ&#39; - &#39;en hemera&#39; - <q>on the day</q>. When. &#39;ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου&#39; - &#39;ek ges Aigyptou&#39; - <q>from the land of Egypt</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here from where the Lord led the Israelites out. &#39;ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ μου&#39; - &#39;en te diatheke mou&#39; - <q>in My Covenant</q>. That is in the agreement with God.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VIII, 10 — &#39;εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;eis ten dianoian auton&#39; - <q>into their minds</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς θεὸν&#39; - &#39;eis theon&#39; - <q>as God</q>. &#39;εἰς λαόν&#39; - &#39;eis laon&#39; - <q>as a people</q>. In both these expressions it is meant, <q>who will be whom</q>.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VIII, 11 — &#39;ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;apo mikrou heos megalou auton&#39; - <q>from the small and even to the great of them</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here the beginning of the count. <q>from the small and even to the great</q> — an indication that also the small will know the Lord, that is that which now not all have. Here is an implicit and indirect indication of the salvation of some non-Christians, who are predominantly called small — in this age, in particular now, they need knowledge of God, enlightenment, but in the future age, in the Kingdom of God those who are saved, will have pure knowledge of God. And by great are called the faithful who will be saved, and they also will have pure knowledge of God; one can expect that between the states of these people there will be a difference, as Paul writes in another Epistle.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VIII, 13 — &#39;ἐν τῷ λέγειν&#39; - &#39;en te legein&#39; - <q>when He says</q>. When. 
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul takes an extensive and precise quotation from the book of the prophet Jeremiah — in the text in Hebrew this is Jeremiah XXXI, 31-34, in the Greek Septuagint — Jeremiah XXXVIII, 31-34 (the Greek and Hebrew texts of the book of the prophet Jeremiah differ significantly, in particular by the order of chapters, but this quotation is the same in both). Judging from everything, he also often used these words in discussions with Jews regarding the commandments of Christ.
</p>
<p>
An important point from the prophecy is also that the fulfilment of New Testament commandments requires knowledge of God. And those who do not know the true God, cannot be established in the New Testament commandments, even though they might sometimes by God&#39;s grace act accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Also this indicates how they need to be fulfilled — through faith in Christ, through love for God and people etc. Other fulfilment does not correspond to the quotation and is <q>imperfect</q>, if one can express it so. Also it is necessary to say that it is spoken about the fulfilment of all commandments, and not their part, or only some of them. 
</p>

<reading>(Mark VIII, 11-21) </reading><br>
Mark VIII, 11 — &#39;παρ&#39; αὐτοῦ σημεῖον ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ&#39; — &#39;par autou semeion apo tou ouranou&#39; - <q>from beside Him a sign from heaven</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here in the form before the following vowel is with the genitive case. Such construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, also regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/Pryjmennyky.html</a><br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf</a><br>
Here it indicates that they wanted, besides Christ Himself (that is the sinlessness and miracles of Jesus were <q>not enough</q> for them), to receive also a sign, a sign from heaven. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that the sign was to <q>leave</q> heaven. In general the use of prepositions additionally shows the erroneousness of their logic.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 13 — &#39;εἰς τὸ πέραν&#39; — &#39;eis to peran&#39; - <q>to the other side</q>. A common expression. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ&#39; — &#39;en to ploio&#39; - <q>in the boat</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 15 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ τῆς ζύμης Ἡρῴδου&#39; — &#39;apo tes zymes ton pharisaion kai tes zymes Herodou&#39; - <q>from the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that they need to beware of them in every way.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII, 19 — &#39;εἰς τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους&#39; — &#39;eis tous pentakiskhilious&#39; - <q>for the five thousand</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Mark VIII. 20 — &#39;εἰς τοὺς τετρακισχιλίους&#39; — &#39;eis tous tetrakiskhilious&#39; - <q>for the four thousand</q>. Analogously to the previous.
