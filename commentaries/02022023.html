<p>From the daily reading of the repetition of the reading on January 25, see the analysis at the link:</p>

<p><reading>(James III, 11  &ndash; IV, 6) </reading>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order not to repeat myself, I just spread the idea, because from what is written briefly (but completely) the person can search for conclusions for a long time. Envy in its own sense is not just a desire for something that one's neighbour has, but a desire for <q>exactly (exclusively, just that and only) that and exactly (exclusively, just and only) such</q>. And that is why it is impossible under any conditions (God does not want that, the world was created this way). But in the world there is a whole group of <q>copies</q> of different originals, there is a concept of imitation, which in general are not necessarily manifestations of envy.</p>
<p>For example, Paul says: <q>follow me, as I follow Christ.</q></p>
<p>Children imitate the behavior of their parents and do it not out of envy. They don't want to have just precisely what their parents have, instead they align their behavior with theirs. The learning process takes a lot from imitation (<q>Do as...hellip;</q>). But normally, a person does not seek to <q>take away</q> someone else's, it does not interest him / her in itself, but he / she is interested in this similarity, which should become part of his / her own life. He / She is interested in those properties and characteristics which a person wants to receive as his / her own in his / her own life, existence.</p>
<p>In science and creative activity, there are concepts of <q>fair usage</q> and plagiarism. All these questions are closely related to envy. But the main thing is to begin to understand that it is simply impossible to <q>transfer</q> something, preserving all the properties, characteristics and relations in which the original is with the whole world. Therefore, the question is resolved in what is <q>fair use</q>. The very commandment (commandments) not to be jealous allows you to build personal, social and group boundaries, frameworks etc. It allows civilization to move forward.</p>
<p>You can also say that <q>don't be jealous, create your own, don't copy, be an original creative person, etc.</q> â€” all this is primarily necessary for humanity to develop.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
