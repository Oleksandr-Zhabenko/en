<p>(1 Corinthians IX, 2-12) I wrote earlier about the reading, see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="04082023.html">04082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>(Matthew XVIII, 23-35) Matthew XVIII, 24 - ‘μυριων’ - ‘myrion’ - ‘ten
thousand; an innumerable number’. It is traditionally translated as ten
thousand, although the point is not the number, but the innumerability,
the impossibility of even counting them completely.</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 26, 29 - ‘μακροθυμησον’ - ‘makrothymeson’ - ‘be
long-suffering, enduring’. ‘εμοι’ - ‘emoi’ - ‘me’ (over me). The
requests of the slaves differ only in one word - the first debtor says:
<q>I will return everything</q>, while the second one says <q>I will return</q>.
You can see that the first debtor overestimates his abilities and
exaggerates his capabilities with his words. In reality, he cannot pay
back what he cannot even count. Nevertheless, the master of the slaves
does not pick up on the details, but shows general mercy.</p>
<p>It is known that a talent was equal to 6,000 denarii, and a denarius
was a day’s wage for a labourer. A myrion of talents is an astronomical
amount (if we assume that it is 10,000, as is often translated, then it
is 60,000,000 denarii, i.e. if a year has 365 days (on average, a little
more - almost 365.25), then it will be 164,271 something years without
days off and breaks), and if we assume that this is a figurative
expression of innumerability, then the number cannot even be
calculated.</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 32 - ‘πονηρε’ - ‘ponere’ - <q>evil (in terms of the
result of activity, as a final result), wicked</q>.</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 35 - ‘αφητε’ - ‘aphete’ - ‘let go, release, lose, set
free; destroy (as an army in battle); forgive debts; leave, let go (also
has other meanings that do not seem appropriate in this context, in
general, the word is very multivalent)’. Let me focus on the many
meanings of this word. In general, its clearest meaning in the New
Testament is <q>forgive</q>, and the form of forgiveness (as it should be, as
it manifests itself) is <q>let go, allow to go</q>. That is, in the most
general sense, the Gospel’s forgiveness and commandments relate to the
<q>letting go</q> of sins and debts, allowing them to <q>not affect us</q>,
becoming <q>invulnerable to them</q> because they <q>passed us by</q>, etc. In
this sense, an unforgiven sin <q>hits</q> the person who does not forgive,
and thus hurts them. And <q>forgive</q> means to make the sin <q>pass by
without hitting</q>. This corresponds to dodging a blow in martial arts -
sin <q>hits</q> a person, and the one who forgives it in the Gospel sense
<q>dodges the blow</q>. But the same word also has the meaning of <q>to defeat
an army in a battle or war</q> - that is, in certain cases, forgiveness is
equivalent to a complete and final victory in a war or battle. Sometimes
forgiveness can mean setting aside, i.e. being safe, not just <q>dodging
the attack</q> but <q>moving to a safe place</q>. And so on, in other words,
Christian forgiveness is multifaceted and has many manifestations and
forms.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the master in the parable refers to God (most
often the Father is understood, but the Trinity in general can be spoken
of). And the debtors are people. Debts are sins, anything that violates
or is not consistent with God’s will and purpose.</p>
<p>I will focus on whether people really owe God so much.</p>
<p>To understand the case, you need to consider what is written in the
works at the links:
<br><a class="link2" href="06042023.html">06042023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="19052023.html">19052023.html</a><br>

<p>Each person’s relationships with God are qualitatively different from
those with other people, and therefore the debts people owe to God are
innumerable. nevertheless, God shows mercy and longsuffering to people.
And He teaches us to be similar to Him.</p>
