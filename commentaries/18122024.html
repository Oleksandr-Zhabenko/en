it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(1 Timothy I, 18-20, II, 8-15) </reading><br>
1 Timothy I, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐταῖς’ - ‘en autais’ - ‘in them; with them’. It means ‘in accordance with them’.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy II, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ’ - ‘en panti topo’ - ‘in every place; everywhere’. The meaning is the second option.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy II, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν καταστολῇ’ - ‘en katastole’ - ‘in the apparel’. This is the only translation that makes sense here. ‘ἐν πλέγμασιν’ - ‘en plegmasin’ - ‘in hair braiding; with hair braiding’. The second option is preferable, as it is clearer.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy II, 11 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ μανθανέτω ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ’ - ‘en hesykhia manthaneto en pase hypotage’ - ‘in quietness let her learn in complete submissiveess; in silence let her learn in complete submissiveness; with quietness let her learn in complete submissiveness’. There are different translations, and it is not really clear who is supposed to be quiet here - the woman or the man who teaches her, because it may mean that the man should be quiet, calm, gentle, and show love, and the woman should respect her husband. In any case, it is about showing love, not restricting someone.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy II, 12 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ’ - ‘en hesykhia’ - ‘in quietness; in silence; in stillness’. The idea that quietness is here for the sake of expressing love, and not as a way of restraint, is further revealed here. The apostle's words are not to be misunderstood as a way of showing restrictions, but as teaching how the mutual love of spouses is manifested in meekness, in mildness. For ‘anger for the sake of learning’ is of little help and can be very harmful.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy II, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν παραβάσει’ - ‘en parabasei’ - ‘into transgression'.

<reading>(Mark X, 11-16) </reading><br>
Mark X, 15 &mdash; ‘εἰς αὐτήν’ - ‘eis auten’ - ‘into it’.
