<reading>(Hebrews VII, 1-6) </reading><br>
This reading is preceded by the ones I wrote about at the following links:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25032023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25032023.html</a><br>

</p>
<p>
This reading continues with the one I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15022023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15022023.html</a>

<p>
Hebrews VII, 2 &mdash; 'ἐμέρισεν' - 'emerisen' - 'divided; separated; shared' - from 'μεριζω'.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VII, 3 &mdash; 'ἡμερῶν' - 'emeron' - 'days'.
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul shows the Jews from the Old Testament story of the meeting of the righteous Melchisedek and Abraham that the prototypes of the Old Testament, of the Holy History, are to be followed by the coming of Christ, who will establish a new priesthood (in fact, it has already taken place in the apostle's time), just as Melchisedec was once honoured above Abraham, who had the promises of God, when he met Abraham, so Christ is the Highest and High Priest forever in comparison with the Jewish priesthood.
</p>
<p>
The very figure and personality of Melchisedec remains mysterious, but the honour he has in connection with this story, as well as his deeply symbolic name, which is also a prototype of the Person of Jesus Christ and His ministry, demands attention and appreciation. The memory of the Saint Melchisedec is celebrated on the Sunday of the Fathers, which precedes the Nativity of Christ.

<reading>(Mark X, 17-27) </reading><br>
A direct continuation of yesterday's reading, which I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20122023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20122023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XIX, 16-26) here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/27082023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/27082023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Cf. also Luke XVIII, 18-30, which is discussed here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22112023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22112023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 21, 27 &mdash; 'ἐμβλέψας' - 'emblepsas' - 'looked (into, upon)'. In Mark we see Jesus' human qualities more clearly.

Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
