<p><reading>(1 Corinthians VII, 24-35) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians VII, 24  &ndash; ‘παρα Θεω’  &ndash; ‘para
Theo’  &ndash; ‘near God, close to God, ’in the vicinity’ of God’. The point is
that when God called a person and they responded, they were close to
God, and this state of closeness not only needs to be remembered, but it
did not become an obstacle to unity with God in vocation, and therefore
this state does not harm being with God in general. Similarly, the
temple not only does not harm a person to be with God, but is intended
to serve such a purpose. If the calling of the person by God in a
certain state has become possible and effective, then this state can
resemble the temple, with which the state has the just mentioned
similarity.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to give advice, as he did earlier in the letter, as <q>one
who has hope of being faithful</q>. See this link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="18072023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">18072023.html</a></p>
<p>In the following reading, Paul speaks about psychology.</p>
<p>Since people can live, love, think, marry, and so on in different
ways, Paul’s reasoning can be both in tune with and close to each person
in Christ and also quite unusual. If a person lived before marriage
wanting to please God alone, and got married in such a way pleasing a
spouse are now ” a distraction”, then Paul’s words are exactly the
point. If, however, a person has received marriage as a blessing from
God (as, for example, was the case with Isaac, Tobit, Moses, etc. in the
Old Testament), then marriage will not only not be a distraction, but
will help to please God. After all, if we talk about the integrity and
undividedness of a person, the best example is… the Virgin Mary… Who
was… married! And this did not prevent Her from pleasing God entirely.
Therefore, Paul warns, tells, teaches, but his words do not necessarily
take place in people’s lives. We can also say that this is a certain
experience of spiritual life, but it may be different for others.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XV, 12-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 17  &ndash; ‘κοιλιαν’  &ndash; ‘koilian’  &ndash; <q>belly,
heart; generally any organ that is in the abdomen</q>.</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterday’s reading, which was described
here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="19072023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">19072023.html</a></p>
<p>Between the parable and its explanation, Jesus speaks of the
Pharisees. Christ’s words about them show the state of the Pharisees
from different angles  &ndash; their blindness and lack of understanding, their
conviction that they are right, and their desire to lead others, while
they do not see the essence of the matter. As for the pit, it is a
physical example, and a very eloquent one at that: first, logically, the
blind guide, the leader, is supposed to fall into the pit, and then the
one being led by such a leader is supposed to fall into the same pit.
These words of Jesus were fulfilled, in particular, when the Pharisees
came forward to crucify Him.</p>
<p>As for the plants, the Lord means that the truth should not be
stopped by someone’s disagreement with it. At least in the kingdom of
God, the truth will be clear to everyone, so there is no point in giving
it up for the sake of someone’s (false) opinion. For example, scientists
are constantly faced with this question: new knowledge to some extent
changes previous views, which have to be abandoned. If not, then there
is no point in science itself.</p>
<p>With regard to the origin of sins from the human heart, this refers
to the <q>core of the personality</q>, which represents whom a person is as
such. This makes a person a source of those things that come from
themselves, from their heart. This ability to be such a source, such a
cause, is directly related to freedom.</p>
<p>There is a good essay about freedom at the following link:
