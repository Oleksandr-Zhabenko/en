<p>(1 Corinthians X, 12-22) Continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, which
is referred to in the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="25072023.html">25072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Paul says that the faithful are united in the Eucharist, forming one
body, the mystical Body of Christ, the Church.</p>
<p><q>The cup that weâ€¦</q> â€” Holy Communion.</p>
<p>At the same time, Paul clearly testifies about idolatry that these
sacrifices are not offered to God, but to demons. Here it should be
recalled that once in Athens, Paul preached and mentioned the godliness
of the Athenians, who had an altar to the <q>Unknown God</q>, and Paul said
that it was Him that he preached (such a missionary approach, one might
say) (Acts XVII, 22-31) . Why did Paul not characterize the sacrifices
on that altar as idolatry, as sacrifices to demons, and the sacrifices
of Gentiles to idols are sacrifices to demons? What is the
difference?</p>
<p>This is not a very clear question, but you can see the following. The
first time the Gentiles started sacrificing to idols was either
witnessing unusual phenomena that they understood to be <q>gods,</q> or they
invented those <q>gods</q> for various reasons. In both cases, the idols were
the direct result of deception. And deception comes from the evil one,
which is the father of lies and deceit.</p>
<p>When people made sacrifices on the altar to the Unknown God, it was
because ofâ€¦ truth. The truth that they lacked something in paganism,
they were looking for the real God. The truth that they did not know Him
and modestly admitted it. The truth that this was a manifestation of
their true piety (they had to believe in this Unknown God, if, knowing
nothing about Him, they still built an altar to Him, admitting their
ignorance). And therefore, since the Source of truth is the True God,
then this altar was - to Him. But faith in the Unknown God is weak due
to the fact that they did not know how to properly believe in Him and
how important it is.</p>

<p>Paul also goes on to say that Christians cannot be fellow partakers
of God and the devil.</p>
<p>(Matthew XVI, 20-24) Matthew XVI, 23 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™ - â€˜emouâ€™ - <q>Me</q>.</p>
<p>The reading directly follows the events that were read on the feast
of the apostles Peter and Paul.
<br><a class="link2" href="12072023.html">12072023.html</a><br> And here
we can see a situation where Peter receives the opposite
characteristic.</p>
<p>The evangelist does not write after Peter. But about Jesus. The main
person in these two readings is not Peter, but Jesus (as in the entire
Gospel). If we look at Jesus, then in todayâ€™s reading we see the absence
of <q>flirting</q> with people. Jesus is not trying to <q>appease</q> anyone, gain
someoneâ€™s favour through praise, etc. Therefore, He can effectively
respond to the sins of anyone, even those who are close to Him. Personal
attitudes and relationships do not hide the truth from Him.</p>
<p>And with regard to Peter, we see his (as well as other disciples at
that time) weakness, he thought in purely human terms about Godâ€™s
works.</p>
<p>As I wrote before, I want to write more about these two readings and
others, but it will take time, because they are instructive in many
ways. So for now I will stop only on this.</p>
<p>I will also note that Peter, having received a severe direct rebuke,
did not cease to be an apostle.</p>
<p>There is a good essay about the cross at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="19032023.html">19032023.html</a><br></p>
<p>To Archangel Gabriel: (Hebrews II, 2-10; Luke X, 16-21) About reading
the Apostle: A very rich theological place, which has several parts. It
says a lot about angels in the context of their greatness and glory,
which is why it is read today.</p>
<p>Here it is spoken about 4 <q>subjects</q> - angels, God, people and Jesus
Christ. Moreover, Jesus Christ is both God and man, and His human soul
is similar to angels.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first thing we are talking about is Christ. Paul shows
what glory the angels have, but then he speaks of a human being who is
to have, according to Godâ€™s design, almost the same glory. And now they
do not have, but Christ has greater glory. Therefore, Christ combines
everything in Himself for the fulfillment of Godâ€™s designs, and he is
also the glory of people and the glory of angels.</p>
<p>Quotation from the Old Testament - Psalm VIII, 5-7. There it is used
<q>a little less than the gods</q> (which is translated as <q>angels</q>). It is
about the fact that angels can be called <q>gods</q> (like also the people)
by the gift of Godâ€™s grace.</p>
<p>About the fact that Christ suffered by grace - see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>About the reading of the Gospel, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="24062023.html">24062023.html</a><br> It is
read to the Archangel, because he also saw the fall of Satan from
heaven, and was a participant in those events on the side of God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
