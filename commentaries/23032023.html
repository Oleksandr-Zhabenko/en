<p>(Isaiah XXVIII, 14-22) In short, the prophecy that people’s rooting
in evil, no matter how constant and habitual it may be for them (<q>an
agreement with death and hell</q>), will not save on the Day of God’s
judgment. What’s more, it will cause a judgment.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand that death and hell are not
masters in their own sense, but human is susceptible to them because of
his / her departure from God. Therefore, <q>deals with death and hell</q> are
really worthless.</p>
<p>This is important to realize for people who seek to <q>build a
relationship with death and hell, for example, through certain
practices</q> (<q>covenants</q>).</p>
<p>Also important is the prophecy about the <q>Cornerstone</q>, which is
Jesus Christ. This prophecy is mentioned many times in the New
Testament.</p>
<p>(Genesis X, 32 - XI, 9) History after the flood — displacement of
people, Tower of Babel, new displacement of people.</p>
<p>Regarding the displacement of people after the flood - the same
questions as regarding the displacement after Paradise. See more at the
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="08032023.html">08032023.html</a><br></p>
<p>It is important to note that modern philology believes that indeed,
all human languages have one common language, from which they then
developed due to the displacement of people. This can be established by
analyzing changes in languages and attempting reconstructions of what we
do not know based on the data that is available.</p>
<p>That is, it actually confirms the key fact of the history of the
Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>But the periodization remains unclear.</p>
<p>If we leave aside the question of time, then the meaning of the event
is that the Lord mixed the languages so that people would get rid of
part of their <q>pride</q> (the desire to <q>reach heaven</q> by their human
powers). At the same time, we see how important unity is in achieving
goals. But human unity is not the same as gracious unity - for the
latter two or three people gathered in the Name of Christ are enough so
that they can do God’s will in everything, while for human unity even
huge gatherings of people united by community, will not always do God’s
will, and therefore will not always have real good success.</p>
<p>The parallel with Pentecost (see the first chapters of the Acts of
the Saint Apostles) is also important - on this day, the Lord (the Holy
Spirit) descended again and united the nations again into the One Church
of Christ through the Mother of God, the apostles and the faithful.</p>
<p>Also, this parallel is an indirect confirmation that the Holy Spirit
is the Lord and God, the Third Hypostasis (Person) of the Holy
Trinity.</p>
<p>(Proverbs XIII, 20 - XIV, 6) The Greek and Hebrew texts are again
quite different for many verses, but generally the structure is similar
to many of the earlier readings.</p>
<p>I will dwell on the verse of Proverbs XIII, 24 - which talks about
corporal punishment of children for their upbringing. As I wrote
earlier, corporal punishment was customary in those distant times, so
these words did not specifically refer to them.</p>
<p>In Solomon’s time, there was no pedagogics, there were no educational
institutions of various types and forms for teachers and students, and
even the wise Solomon himself could not organize general education and
training according to the best modern models.</p>
<p>But it is clear that it is about the very principle of education - it
is necessary to educate, even if it is not easy. But corporal punishment
for this - in fact, the Scriptures do not oblige anyone (at least
anyone) to use them. That is, it is not a question of methods and means
of education, but only of its necessity and importance (relevance).</p>
<p>A simple example of the fact that God can change what is needed - in
the desert with Moses, the Israelites carried the ark of the Covenant
and had no built temple. It was God’s will because they were traveling
to the Promised Land. And later it was already God’s will to build a
temple in this land. And even later - to build synagogues, and after the
Coming of Christ - Christian temples throughout the earth.</p>
<p>All this is necessary in due time.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
