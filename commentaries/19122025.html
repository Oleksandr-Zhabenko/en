it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

The research material is currently being prepared for publication. I hope, God willing, to present fuller results later after the publication comes out.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Titus I, 15-II, 10) </reading><br>
Titus I, 15 — &#39;καὶ ὁ νοῦς καὶ ἡ συνείδησις&#39; — &#39;kai ho nous kai he syneidesis&#39; - <q>both the mind and the consciousness; both the mind and the conscience</q>. Here important is the distinction through naming the two sequentially — under mind can be considered that which is more innate, and under conscience and consciousness — that which is more acquired, connected with experience, more individual. Right thoughts are capable of correcting negative experience and consequences, and wrong thoughts can destroy even positive experience. Mention of both together in this context means that those people both think erroneously and live sinfully. 
</p>
<p>
Titus II, 3 — &#39;ἐν καταστήματι&#39; - &#39;en katastemati&#39; - <q>in behaviour; with behaviour</q>. It is spoken about active virtues.
</p>
<p>
Titus II, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te didaskalia&#39; - <q>in teaching</q>.
</p>
<p>
Titus II, 8 — &#39;ὁ ἐξ ἐναντίας&#39; - &#39;ho ex enantias&#39; - <q>the one who is from the opposition; the one who is from the opponents</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that it is spoken about a representative of the group of opponents who made or make opposition to faith and the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
Titus II, 9, 10 — &#39;ἐν πᾶσιν&#39; - &#39;en pasin&#39; - <q>in all things</q>. In what. About slaves and masters I wrote regarding other places at the links:<br>

<p>
The Apostle Paul teaches all to godliness, in brief but meaningful words. The words are not accidentally connected by how they came associatively to Paul&#39;s mind, but their sequence indicates the path of teaching and acquisition of various virtues.
</p>
<p>
Regarding women and men — Paul uses a word which means close relations, friendship, also emotional love, that is, so that women be the closest friends of their husbands. About <q>listening</q> — see regarding this question more deeply at the link:<br>

<reading>(Luke XX, 19-26) </reading><br>
Luke XX, 19 — &#39;ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ&#39; — &#39;en aute te hora&#39; - <q>in that hour; then</q>. Common expression. When.
