What did Judas' kiss point to (indicate)? He pointed out that Judas had not taken anything for himself during the years of his close stay with Jesus, had not learned anything. But Judas didn't think about it. He didn't want to learn anything. And the devil found a way to seduce him. And the worst part is not even that he actually crossed out his whole life with betrayal, but that he sought to destroy Jesus, His work, and also crossed out the lives of other disciples of Jesus. Judas never saw Jesus as a Savior, did not cognize Him, and later perished in despair.

Let's take a look at another question, what should a kiss be for it to be good? You can reason
differently, but one thought is obviously correct — it must point to (indicate) God, that is, to
actually be from God. And, of course, not to be from the evil one. And it must be said that it is
almost impossible to imagine a situation where a kiss from God does not also point to (indicate) the
soul (and possibly the body) at the same time. God in this sense does not <q>monopolize</q>, does not
appropriate the meaning of a kiss to Himself, but wants the soul (and possibly the body) to
participate in the fact that creation is sanctified as it approaches the Creator.<br> 
In this case, even what points to the body will be good, as the Apostle says, because what is done
<q>in the Lord</q> (unfortunately, I quote by heart, I could not find it in the Epistles). The human
condition, when his / her kiss is in the Lord is called the holistic state, the state of integrity,
the Slavic <q>целомудрие</q>, because it points not only to the whole person, to his / her whole nature,
but also to his / her purpose, to his  / her vocation, to his strength and growth, and the like — to
God.<br> 
Being in this state, If affirmed, is also called the same word.

Luke emphasizes the judges’ bias towards Jesus, the fact that the
sentence was known ahead of time.</p>
<p>On the threefold renunciation of Peter and Jesus, there is a good
piece at the link (sorry for just Ukrainian version at the moment):

<p><q>Prophecise to us who struck Thee!</q>, — a manifestation of blasphemy
on Jesus, but also on prophecy  &ndash; the meaning of prophecy is not to
communicate certain knowledge, but to bring closer to God. Instead of
approaching God, warriors simply scoff.</p>
<p>Lord through His long-suffering saves us.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
