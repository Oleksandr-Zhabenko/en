<p><reading>(Jude I, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the daily Apostle was read the beginning of the
Catholic Epistle of the Apostle Jude (one of the 12 apostles, a close
relative of the apostle James, the brother of the Lord (i.e., Jesus’
half-relative through Joseph Betrothed). In scripture, siblings are
generally referred to close relatives (in particular, cousins and second
cousins).</p>
<p>For me, the saint apostle is remembered because, according to my
calculations, on his Remembrance Day, July 2, 2001, events occurred that
directly led me to the decision to become a good Christian, about that
now is not the time to speak in detail. One of my beloved saints.</p>
<p>It is believed that the epistle is written at about the same time as
the epistles of the apostle Peter, and quite possibly, that about the
same people. At least when comparing topics, positions and statements
easily one can find many parallels. Therefore, since I wrote about
Peter’s epistles recently, I suggest to recall again what he wrote then,
since it applies in the same way to the epistle of the apostle Jude.

<p>There are relatively detailed questions that arise when reading
today’s words.</p>
<p>On the dispute between the Archangel Michael and the devil about the
body of Moses — described in the apocryphal book, which at that time was
common among the Jews. It is understood that the Lord hid through the
Archangel Michael the body of Moses, lest the Israelites, remembering
all that the Lord did through him, should not be attributed to himself
God’s dignity (as the Gentiles could do) and did not begin to worship
him as a god.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXII, 39-42, 45  &ndash; XXIII, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the daily Gospel it was read
about prayer in Gethsemane, the capture of Jesus, judgment before the
Sanhedrin, the abdication of Peter and the mockery of the imprisoned
Jesus. Given the significance of events for our salvation  &ndash; very deep
and informative texts, due to the lack of space I will focus only on a
few important details for perhaps a better understanding.</p>
<p>There is a good work on cheerfulness and spirit at the link:

<p>— <q>Judas, do you give out the Son of Man with a
kiss?</q>, — the question of God the Creator to man, which shows that God
created kisses for love, closeness (intimacy), special manifestation of
personality, when through the body is also revealed something that is
not reduced only to the body. The kiss is created by God by design as a
sign, that is, it always means something, points to something, but Judas
distorted himself in a way that commits a serious sin by kissing as a
sign of his betrayal, a sign of the evil one. A kiss may point to (be
related to) the body, may point to the soul, may — to the evil one (as
in the case of Judas’s kiss), or may — to God. The Lord reveals the depth
of Judas’ fall by calling him to repentance through manifestation of his
sin (oh, if Judas had really thought about the words of Christ, he could
repent, instead he died in despair afterwards).</p>
<p>
The following two paragraphs were added on February 22, 2023.<br>
What did Judas' kiss point to (indicate)? He pointed out that Judas had not taken anything for himself during the years of his close stay with Jesus, had not learned anything. But Judas didn't think about it. He didn't want to learn anything. And the devil found a way to seduce him. And the worst part is not even that he actually crossed out his whole life with betrayal, but that he sought to destroy Jesus, His work, and also crossed out the lives of other disciples of Jesus. Judas never saw Jesus as a Savior, did not cognize Him, and later perished in despair.                                                                             
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at another question, what should a kiss be for it to be good? You can reason
differently, but one thought is obviously correct — it must point to (indicate) God, that is, to
actually be from God. And, of course, not to be from the evil one. And it must be said that it is
almost impossible to imagine a situation where a kiss from God does not also point to (indicate) the
soul (and possibly the body) at the same time. God in this sense does not <q>monopolize</q>, does not
appropriate the meaning of a kiss to Himself, but wants the soul (and possibly the body) to
participate in the fact that creation is sanctified as it approaches the Creator.<br> 
In this case, even what points to the body will be good, as the Apostle says, because what is done
<q>in the Lord</q> (unfortunately, I quote by heart, I could not find it in the Epistles). The human
condition, when his / her kiss is in the Lord is called the holistic state, the state of integrity,
the Slavic <q>целомудрие</q>, because it points not only to the whole person, to his / her whole nature,
but also to his / her purpose, to his  / her vocation, to his strength and growth, and the like — to
God.<br> 
Being in this state, If affirmed, is also called the same word.

Luke emphasizes the judges’ bias towards Jesus, the fact that the
sentence was known ahead of time.</p>
<p>On the threefold renunciation of Peter and Jesus, there is a good
piece at the link (sorry for just Ukrainian version at the moment):

<p><q>Prophecise to us who struck Thee!</q>, — a manifestation of blasphemy
on Jesus, but also on prophecy  &ndash; the meaning of prophecy is not to
communicate certain knowledge, but to bring closer to God. Instead of
approaching God, warriors simply scoff.</p>
<p>Lord through His long-suffering saves us.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
