<reading>(Jude I, 1-10) </reading><br>
From the daily Apostle was read the beginning of the Catholic Epistle of the Apostle Jude (one of<br>
the 12 apostles, a close relative of the apostle James, the brother of the Lord (i.e., Jesus' half-relative through<br>
Joseph Betrothed). In scripture, siblings are generally referred to close relatives (in particular,<br>
cousins and second cousins).
</p>
<p>
For me, the saint apostle is remembered because, according to my calculations, on his<br>
Remembrance Day, July 2, 2001, events occurred that directly led me to the decision to become <br>
a good Christian, about that now is not the time to speak in detail. One of my beloved saints.
</p>
<p>
It is believed that the epistle is written at about the same time as the epistles of the apostle<br>
Peter, and quite possibly, that about the same people. At least when comparing topics, positions <br>
and statements easily one can find many parallels. Therefore, since I wrote about Peter's epistles <br>
recently, I suggest to recall again what he wrote then, since it applies in the same way to the <br>
epistle of the apostle Jude.<br>

<p>
There are relatively detailed questions that arise when reading today's words.
</p>
<p>
On the dispute between the Archangel Michael and the devil about the body of Moses — described in<br>
the apocryphal book, which at that time was common among the Jews. It is understood that the Lord <br>
hid through the Archangel Michael the body of Moses, lest the Israelites, remembering all that the <br>
Lord did through him, should not be attributed to himself God's dignity (as the Gentiles could do)<br>
and did not begin to worship him as a god.
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XXII, 39-42, 45 &mdash; XXIII, 1) </reading><br>
From the daily Gospel it was read about prayer in Gethsemane, the capture of Jesus, judgment<br>
before the Sanhedrin, the abdication of Peter and the mockery of the imprisoned Jesus. Given <br>
the significance of events for our salvation &mdash; very deep and informative texts, due to the lack of <br>
space I will focus only on a few important details for perhaps a better understanding. 
</p>
<p>
There is a good work on cheerfulness and spirit at the link:<br>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XXII, 48) </reading>— <q>Jude, do you give out the Son of Man with a kiss?</q>, — the question of God the<br>
Creator to man, which shows that God created kisses for love, closeness (intimacy), special<br>
manifestation of personality, when through the body is also revealed something that is not<br>
reduced only to the body. The kiss is created by God by design as a sign, that is, it always means something, <br>
points to something, but Jude distorted himself in a way that commits a serious sin by kissing <br>
as a sign of his betrayal, a sign of the evil one. A kiss may point to (be related to) the body, <br>
may point to the soul, may — to the evil one (as in the case of Jude's kiss), or may — to God.<br>
The Lord reveals the depth of Jude's fall by calling him to repentance through manifestation of his<br>
sin (oh, if Jude had really thought about the words of Christ, he could repent, instead<br>
he died in despair afterwards).
</p>
<p>
The work on the judgment of Jesus in the Sanhedrin is available at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0rWZooKLaV3sgeM8fdVkPKAYBv8p6Cg3Y5HGBUKtHAV3w9pFQ9foEi4WTk8uqFmv2l">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a><br>
Luke emphasizes the judges' bias towards Jesus, the fact that the sentence was known ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
On the threefold renunciation of Peter and Jesus, there is a good piece at the link (sorry for just<br>
Ukrainian version at the moment):<br>

</p>
<p>
<q>Prophecise to us who struck Thee!</q>, — a manifestation of blasphemy on Jesus, but also on prophecy <br>
- the meaning of prophecy is not to communicate certain knowledge, but to bring closer<br>
to God. Instead of approaching God, warriors simply scoff.
</p>
<p>
Lord through His long-suffering saves us.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!
