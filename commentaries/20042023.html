<p>Peter testifies to the need for Baptism, which from
now on became the Sacrament of the Church through the action of God‚Äôs
grace, the grace of the Holy Spirit. There are good works about the
action of grace and the Sacraments at the following links:

<p>Acts II, 40 ‚Äî the word ‚ÄòœÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒµŒπ‚Äô is used, which has common root
with the name of the Holy Spirit -the Comforter, that is, Peter
comforted people with those words, in English ‚Äòencouraged‚Äô, that is,
encouraged and inspired, strengthened in determination and courage.</p>
<p>Acts II, 43 ‚Äî <q>fear</q>, that is, wonder, great surprise and for some
people also a certain delight. The fathers attributed surprise and
wonder to <q>fear</q>, without a significant distinction between wonder and
proper fear itself. Thus, St.¬†John Damascene writes that the fear of
some extraordinary phenomenon is <q>surprise</q>. And the fear of a great
phenomenon is <q>horror.</q> At the same time, he quotes the work of Nemesius
<q>On the nature of man</q>, chapter 20. That is, it should be understood
that way, not that everyone was really <q>afraid or scared</q> of the
apostles, but that everyone was extremely surprised, amazed and / or
fascinated by the extraordinarity and greatness of these events.</p>

<p>Nicodemus is one of my beloved saints, whose memory
is on the third Sunday after Easter, as well as on August 2 (15).</p>
<p>John III, 4 ‚Äî <q>mother‚Äôs womb</q> ‚Äî literally <q>mother‚Äôs belly.</q></p>
<p>The image of the wind in Jesus means that there are many phenomena or
things that we know, even among the simplest and most common, but which
happen in an incomprehensible way for us, have fundamental difficulties
to cognize fully for us (that is, for people). People notice the wind at
the point of observation (most often, where they are), but do not know
all the details of its formation and movement. It must be said that,
therefore, weather forecasts are indicative in nature. Suffice it to say
that the most famous random number generator (the random.org site) uses
as a source of entropy (uncertainty) changes in the atmosphere, air
movement, and also that the equations of air movement in the atmosphere
have chaotic behavior, that is, the smallest changes in parameters lead
to to significant changes in solutions (a phenomenon associated with the
well-known Lorentz attractor and the butterfly effect).</p>
<p>John III, 12 ‚Äî <q>earthly</q> ‚Äî in the original ‚Äî <q>super-earthly</q>, and
<q>heavenly</q> ‚Äî in the original <q>super-heavenly</q>. Here is an important
point. What is said about the wind is beyond earthly understanding (a
mystery for people until now), but what is said about spiritual depths
(heights or something else) is super-heavenly. If the <q>super-earthly</q>
can be known by human reason (for example, science), then the
<q>super-heavenly</q> can only be known through the Revelation of the One who
is Higher than the heavens, God. Here again is indirect evidence that
Christ is the God-human. And the second important thought: a person
almost always (as intended by God) believes in what he can understand
(understand in a broad sense). Christ does not say <q>How will you
understand if‚Ä¶?</q>, but <q>How will you believe if‚Ä¶?</q>. In order to believe,
one must begin to understand, that is, faith in these words of Christ is
always the result of understanding and is itself conscious, not blind.
Nevertheless, the word <q>faith</q> in the New Testament has multiple
meanings, so it is not clear whether the word <q>faith</q> should always mean
conscious and come from a process of meaning getting faith.</p>

<p>The expression <q>to enter the Kingdom of God</q>, according to my belief,
means <q>already now, in this life, to be able to live like life in the
Kingdom of God, thus getting a certain experience of such a life
and</q>tasting it‚Äù to a certain extent.‚Äù Then all the places in the Gospels
where this expression is used have an accessible understanding and raise
fewer additional questions. <q>Can‚Äôt get in</q>  &ndash; can‚Äôt get that real
experience in that state.</p>
