it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

The research material is currently being prepared for publication. I hope, God willing, to present fuller results later after the publication comes out.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews IV, 1-13) </reading><br>
Hebrews IV, 1, 3, 10 — &#39;εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν (αὐτοῦ)&#39; - &#39;eis ten katapausin (autou)&#39; - <q>into (His) rest</q>. Where to. God <q>entered</q> into His rest on the seventh day of creation, blessing the creation, and the Jews always remember this on the Sabbath. Thus the perfection of creation is shown, and that those unfaithful people will not enter there, means that they will not attain perfection, will not fulfil God&#39;s design, will not reach the goal, and this means that they perish. &#39;τις ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;tis ex hymon&#39; - <q>someone from us</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;hy&#39; indicates that that person represents the group, and therefore, the words said about someone one, actually concern all.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 3 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου&#39; - &#39;en te orge mou&#39; - <q>in My wrath</q>. Here God is anthropomorphically compared with a person who is angry, to which the beginning of the verse at the beginning of the quotation in chapter III indicates. &#39;ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου&#39; - &#39;apo kataboles kosmou&#39; - <q>from the foundation of the world</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here the beginning of the count of time.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 4, 10 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ&#39; - &#39;en te hemera te hebdome&#39; - <q>on the seventh day</q>. When. &#39;ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;apo panton ton ergon autou&#39; - <q>from all His own works</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that God completely <q>rested</q> from His own works.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 5 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; - &#39;en touto&#39; - <q>in this</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 6 — &#39;εἰς αὐτήν&#39; - &#39;eis auten&#39; - <q>into it</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 7 — &#39;ἐν Δαυεὶδ&#39; - &#39;en Daueid&#39; - <q>in David</q>. Similar to a direct quote from the psalms of David by the apostle.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 10 — &#39;ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ θεός&#39; - &#39;hosper apo ton idion ho theos&#39; - <q>similarly, as God from His own</q>. It is spoken about complete rest.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews IV, 11 — &#39;εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν&#39; - &#39;eis ekeinen ten katapausin&#39; - <q>to that rest</q>. Where to. &#39;ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en to auto&#39; - <q>in it</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
The apostle uses words of indefiniteness. Here I will stop to delve a little deeper. We believe and confess that the Lord opened the mind of the apostles for understanding the Scripture, at the same time here we see that Paul did not understand everything in it clearly and finally, but at the same time he found in the Scripture under the action of the Holy Spirit that which was needed for the resolution of these or those questions, ultimately for the salvation and well-being not only of himself, but also of many. Therefore it is necessary to understand that in the Scripture there always remain certain questions which are not entirely clear, but at the same time from it one can always receive sufficient lesson and learn to fulfil God&#39;s will.
</p>
<p>
Regarding <q>God&#39;s rest</q> I wrote yesterday regarding the previous place:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22122025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22122025.html</a><br>
God <q>entered</q> into His rest on the seventh day of creation, blessing the creation, and the Jews always remember this on the Sabbath. Thus the perfection of creation is shown, and that those unfaithful people will not enter there, means that they will not attain perfection, will not fulfil God&#39;s design, will not reach the goal, and this means that they perish.
</p>
<p>
Finally the today&#39;s reading concludes with the confession of God&#39;s omniscience and the openness of all creation to the Word of God.
