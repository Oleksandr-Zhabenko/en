it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

To Saint Gregory the Theologian:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XII, 7-11; John X, 9-16) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XII, 9 &mdash; ‘πίστις ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ πνεύματι’ - ‘pistis en to auto pneumati’ - ‘faith in the same Spirit; faith by the same Spirit’. Both translations are possible, the second emphasising the personal character of the Holy Spirit, that He actively acts and gives as a Hypostasis. ‘ἐν τῷ ἑνὶ πνεύματι’ - ‘en to heni pneumati’ - ‘in one Spirit; by one Spirit’. Similar to the previous one.

</p>
<p>
John X, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῆς αὐλῆς ταύτης’ - ‘ek tes aules tautes’ - ‘from this yard (for sheep); from this sheepfold’. The preposition ‘ek’ here answers the question ‘from where?’, i.e. it does not carry the sense of essentiality. Origin is not so important for Christians.

<p>
<reading>(Matthew XXV, 1-13) </reading><br>
Matthew XXV, 1 &mdash; ‘εἰς ὑπάντησιν τοῦ νυμφίου’ - ‘eis hyantesin tou nymphiou’ - ‘’for the meeting (during the procession) of the bridegroom; to meet the bridegroom‘’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 2 &mdash; ‘πέντε δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν’ - ‘pente de ex auton’ - ‘five of them’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates selection from a group (of people).
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις’ - ‘en tois angeiois’ - ‘in the vessels’. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἀπάντησιν’ - ‘eis apantesin’ - ‘for the meeting; to meet’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 8 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ ἐλαίου’ - ‘ek tou elaiou’ - ‘from (that) oil’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates from where they wanted to take the oil for themselves.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς τοὺς γάμους’ - ‘eis tous gamous’ - ‘into the wedding; for the wedding’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates both movement and purpose.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXV, 13 &mdash; ‘γρηγορεῖτε οὖν, ὅτι οὐκ οἴδατε τὴν ἡμέραν οὐδὲ τὴν ὥραν’ - ‘gregoreite oun hoti ouk oidate ten hemeran oude ten horan’ - ‘be awake (as those who do not sleep at night against those who are sleeping, who stay awake at night as opposed to those who sleep), be aware, therefore, because you do not see (know, perceive, consider) neither day nor hour (a certain defined period of time, a certain moment in time); watch, therefore, for you see neither day nor hour’. There are no prepositions here, but the thought is very eloquent, so I will dwell on it in more detail. Christ likens the fact that we do not know the time of His Second Coming, and often, and mostly, the time of our own death, to the night (and for those who will be alive at His glorious Coming, to midnight). The virgins all fell asleep before the arrival of the bridegroom, although they were waiting for him. If the unwise virgins had been awake and watching for the bridegroom, they would have realised what would happen to them without oil when the bridegroom came. Instead, they fell asleep without realising, contrary to the main idea of the parable. Even the wise fell asleep. Instead, Christ calls us all to be awake in not knowing, when we do not see Him, to not sleep in the darkness of ignorance. We do not know the general circumstances just before the end of the world (which are figuratively included in the concept of ‘the day’ (see more at<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7cEETLs_Qe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.instagram.com/p/C7cEETLs_Qe/</a><br>
), nor the specific circumstances and time (which are included in the concept of ‘’hour‘’, for more information see<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/09022023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/09022023.html</a><br>

on pages 84-85), this non-seeing is fundamental and does not allow us to say with certainty that the Second Coming will come right now (see the interesting paradox of expectation and surprise here (there are translations of the book):<br>

but we can be vigilant, watchful in the night. Ignorance, like the night, does not help faith, but it cannot significantly harm it (just as the night itself does not harm vigilance). If a person can stay awake in the dark, then they can believe. The Lord says that this kind of waiting in faith and diligent readiness should be our task.
