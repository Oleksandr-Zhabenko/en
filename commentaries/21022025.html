it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(2 John I, 1-13) </reading><br>
2 John I, 1 &mdash; ‘ἀγαπῶ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ’ - ‘agapo en aletheia’ - ‘I love in truth; I truly love’. Both translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἡμῖν’ - ‘en hemin’ - ‘in us’. ‘εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα’ - ‘eis ton aiona’ - ‘forever’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 3 &mdash; ‘παρὰ θεοῦ πατρός, καὶ παρὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ πατρός’ - ‘para theou patros, kai para Iesou CHristou tou hyiou tou patros' - <q>from beside God the Father and from beside Jesus Christ, the Son of God</q>. The preposition ‘para’ is used here with the genitive case. Such a construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, as well as in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. It indicates here the Holy Spirit and that grace, mercy and peace are given through the Holy Spirit. ‘ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἀγάπῃ’ - ‘en aletheia kai agape’ - ‘in truth and love; with truth and love’. There are two possible translations, the first indicating that truth and love are necessary for the gifts mentioned, and the second that the former lead to the latter.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῶν τέκνων’ - ‘ek ton teknon’ - ‘of the children’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that these people are from a group of children. ‘ἐν ἀληθείᾳ’ - ‘en aletheia’ - ‘in truth; with truth’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that a virtuous devout life has truth as its essential component, and the second that these children live a genuine life, a true life. ‘παρὰ τοῦ πατρός’ - ‘para tou patros’ - ‘from beside the Father’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case. Such a construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father and in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. It indicates that they have received through the Holy Spirit as Christians.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 5, 6 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς - ‘ap arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the countdown. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτῇ’ - ‘en aute’ - ‘in it; by it’. The first option is more likely, since the commandments themselves are not the source of life, as the apostle Paul testifies to in many places. 
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 7 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν κόσμον’ - ‘eis ton kosmon’ - ‘into the world’. ‘ἐν σαρκί’ - ‘en sarki’ - ‘in the flesh’. That is, having taken on our infirmities.
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ’ - ‘en te didakhe’ - ‘in the teaching; in the doctrine’. 
</p>
<p>
2 John I, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς οἰκίαν’ - ‘eis oikian’ - ‘into the house’. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark XV, 22, 25, 33-41) </reading><br>
Mark XV, 34 &mdash; ‘εἰς τί’ - ‘eis ti’ - ‘for what; for why’. That is, ‘for what purpose?’. That is, ‘where have You gone away from Me?’. It is often emphasised that this refers to the feeling of abandonment by God that Christ experienced as a human in His suffering and death, a feeling that people sometimes experience, He experienced it here for people's salvation. But it is also clear here that Christ as a human being on the cross&hellip; seeks and longs for God. And this is also what He teaches us and sets an example for us. We must also always remember that the Son never distanced Himself from the Father and the Spirit in the Godhead.
</p>
<p>
Mark XV, 38 &mdash; ‘εἰς δύο’ - ‘eis duo’ - ‘in two’. ‘ἀπὸ ἄνωθεν’ - ‘apo anothen’ - ‘(beginning and changing state) from above’. A common expression. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the countdown, and here it is also a general indication that it is from God (‘from above’). 
</p>
<p>
Mark XV, 39 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ἐναντίας’ - ‘ex enantias’ - ‘from opposite'. A common expression. It can also mean that at first the centurion was completely against Christ, but here he recognised Him as righteous and innocent, the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
Mark XV, 40 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ μακρόθεν’ - ‘apo makrothen’ - ‘from afar’. A common expression. ‘ἐν αἷς’ - ‘en hais’ - ‘among them’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Mark XV, 41 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ’ - ‘en te Galilaia’ - ‘in Galilee’. ‘εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα’ - ‘eis Hierosolyma’ - ‘to Jerusalem; into Jerusalem'.
