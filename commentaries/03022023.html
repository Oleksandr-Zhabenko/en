<p><reading>(Mark XIII, 1-8) </reading>
</p>

<p>Today's reading of the Gospel is dedicated to Jesus' prophecy about the destruction of the Jerusalem temple (which fulfilled exactly in 70 AD), as well as about the signs of the approaching end of the world. I wrote more about it earlier, regarding the Gospel from Luke. See:</p>

<p>It is actual now, during the war in Ukraine. I will also note that among the closest disciples of Jesus, Peter's brother, Andrew, is mentioned here.</p>

<p><reading>(2 Peter I, 1-10) </reading>
</p>

<p>The beginning of the 2nd epistle of the apostle Peter (also to every faithful person) was read from the daily Apostle.</p>
<p><q>God and the Lord Jesus Christ</q> means the Father and the Son. The Father is called <q>God</q> in the vast majority of New Testament texts. Nevertheless, Peter believed in the Trinity.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 4  &ndash; <q>partakers of the Divine nature</q>  &ndash; that is, partakers of grace, children of God by grace.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 5-7 describes the Christian way of life. The order can say a lot, let's take a closer look:</p>
<p>1) faith  &ndash; Christian life begins with faith, trust in God, you need to start trusting God, but also be able to trust people, be open enough. This makes it possible to manifest â€”</p>
<p>2) virtues  &ndash; here mainly  &ndash; doing good  &ndash; you need to start (continue) doing good on the basis of faith. Then, acting wisely, judiciously, sometimes prudently, a person</p>
<p>3) gets to know God, God's mercy, strength and love, himself / herself, other people. This knowledge teaches him / her modesty and humility, he / she sees weakness, while at the same time he / she continues to create  &ndash; and this vision, full awareness, cognition gives birth to the ability to control oneself, i.e</p>
<p>4) self-control  &ndash; which allows one to overcome many sins, which also teaches in the world</p>
<p>5) patience â€” endurance in the hope of realizing what was promised by God, which even more cleanses and elevates a person to God, to the true</p>
<p>6) godliness  &ndash; which fulfills a person, protects from sins and leads to love  &ndash; through</p>
<p>7) fraternal love â€” i.e., deep warm relations with others in Christ, which develops real and true</p>
<p>8 ) love. And this last one is the pinnacle of everything, because it contains everything.</p>
<p>And then, a person will not remain barren, his / her life will be full, and the hope of a happy eternity will be certain. In this case, a person will not fall into sins and temptations, which can happen to him / her in other cases.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
