it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts X, 34-43) </reading><br>
Acts x, 35 — <q>ἐν παντὶ ἔθνει</q> - <q>en panti ethnei</q> - <q>in every nation</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 37 — <q>ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας</q> - <q>apo tes Galilaias</q> - <q>from Galilee</q>. The preposition <q>apo</q> indicates the beginning of the list of places where the adult Christ preached. 
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 38 — ‘Ἰησοῦν τὸν ἀπὸ Ναζαρέθ’ - ‘Iesoun ton apo Nazareth’ - ‘Jesus, Who is from Nazareth’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that Nazareth was not the city where Jesus was from, but that He was born in Bethlehem, and that this birth was prophesied about. Christ left Nazareth to preach. 'καταδυναστευομένους ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου' - <q>katadynasteuomenous hypo tou diabolou</q> - <q>treated harshly by the devil</q>. The preposition ‘hypo’ is here with the genitive case and indicates that it is the passive voice of the participle <q>treated harshly'.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 39 — “ἔν τε τῇ χώρᾳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ</q> - <q>en te te khora ton Ioudaion kai en Hierousalem</q> - <q>in both the land of Judaea and Jerusalem</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 40 — <q>ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ</q> - <q>en te trite hemera</q> - <q>on the third day</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 41 — <q>μάρτυσιν τοῖς προκεχειροτονημένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ</q> - <q>martysin tois prokekheirotonemenois hypo tou theou</q> - <q>to the witnesses determined beforehand by God; to the witnesses appointed beforehand by God</q>. The preposition ‘hypo’ is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle ‘determined/appointed’. 'μετὰ τὸ ἀναστῆναι αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν' - <q>meta to anastenai auton ek nekron</q> - <q>after His resurrection from the dead</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> here indicates where Christ's transition took place - from the dead to the living.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 42 — ‘αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ ὡρισμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ κριτὴς ζώντων καὶ νεκρῶν’ - ‘autos estin ho horismenos hypo tou theou krites zonton kai nekron’ - 'He is ordained (appointed, set, as in 'ordained, established in the case of an appointment') by God, the Judge of the living and the dead'. The preposition <q>hypo</q> is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle <q>ordained</q>. The point is not that the Son is not the Judge for some reason and needs to be established, but that every decision of the Trinity includes the decision of the Father in particular, Who is the Root and Beginning of the Godhead.
</p>
<p>
Acts X, 43 — <q>πάντα τὸν πιστεύοντα εἰς αὐτόν</q> - <q>panta ton pisteuonta eis auton</q> - <q>to all those who believe into Him</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here that faith leads to Christ Himself, Who is the goal and destination of the faith.
