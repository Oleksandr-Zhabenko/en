<p><reading>(2 Corinthians XII, 10-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XII, 10, 11  &ndash; ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹  &ndash; eimi -
(I) <q>am</q>. Used for emphasis.</p>
<p>A continuation of Paulâ€™s defence of his personal ministry and of his
co-worker Titus.</p>
<p>Omitted is the place where Paul, for the sake of defence, in an
impulse, tells the story of his conversion and Godâ€™s revelations to him
personally. I wrote about the conversion of Paul (Saul) here:
<br><a class="link2" href="05052023.html">05052023.html</a></p>
<p>For more information on <q>power in weakness</q> see:
<br><a class="link2" href="12072023.html">12072023.html</a></p>
<p>Since the words in verse 10, if understood literally, in the same
sense, are absurd, foolish, Paul mentions this apparent folly in verse
11. It should be borne in mind that <q>weak</q> and <q>strong</q> refers to
different things (not to the same thing), so in fact, despite the
seeming paradox, there is nothing unreasonable about these words.</p>
<p>To <q>praise</q> in the biblical sense is to consider something worthy,
also worthy of recommending to others. Paul means that the Corinthians
should appreciate his work, his gifts from God for their own upbuilding,
his efforts, and those of his co-workers who did the same as Paul (Titus
was not only a co-worker of Paulâ€™s, but also a disciple).</p>
<p>Paul goes on to refute the argument about <q>hidden motives and
actions</q> when his apostleship and love for the Corinthians were
obvious.</p>
<p>Speaking of the <q>estate</q> (<q>treasure</q>), Paul expresses his belief in a
certain progress in the development of society and humanity  &ndash; the next
should be better than the previous. Paul is also saying that the next
generations are supposed to live better than the previous ones,
according to Godâ€™s design. If this is not the case, it is not right.</p>
<p>Verse 19 shows that often people who justify themselves feel some
kind of guilt and remorse, so Paul, denying justification, testifies
that he is not guilty of anything in his apostolic ministry to the
Corinthians.</p>

sower in Matthew, see this link:

<p>Also, a good thought on the parable and especially its conclusion is
found in the work here:

<p>To Saint Joasaph, Bishop of Bilgorod: (Hebrews XIII, 17-21; John X,
9-16) For a frequent reading from the Apostle, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="14052023.html">14052023.html</a></p>
<p>John X, 9, 11, 14  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is used only with
emphasis. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John X, 14  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±â€™  &ndash; â€˜emaâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™.</p>
