it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

the latter — once or twice a month (in Ukrainian), to keep the text version current and up to date.
</p>
<p>
Since yesterday was a great feast on a weekday, yesterday&#39;s readings are transferred to today. I give both in turn.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews X, 35-XI, 7) </reading><br>
About the beginning of the reading (verses Hebrews X, 35-38 ) see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22032025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/22032025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Hebrews X, 39 — &#39;ὑποστολῆς εἰς ἀπώλειαν&#39; - &#39;hypostoles eis apoleian&#39; - <q>(of) those who timidly secretly draw back into perdition</q>. Where to. &#39;πίστεως εἰς περιποίησιν ψυχῆς&#39; - &#39;pisteos eis peripoiesin psykhes&#39; - <q>(of) believers for the preservation (obtaining) of the soul</q>. Faith preserves the soul, not allowing to withdraw into perdition. That is faith is connected with boldness — in particular also with the boldness to believe.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 2 — &#39;ἐν ταύτῃ&#39; - &#39;en taute&#39; - <q>in it; with it</q>. Both variants of translation are possible. The first indicates faith as that in which those who received good testimony abode, and the second — that faith itself testifies well about them.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 3 — &#39;εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι&#39; - &#39;eis to me ek phainomenon to blepomenon gegonenai&#39; - <q>so that not from things manifest (evident) those (things) which are visible, came into being</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here from where the transition occurred. The key to understanding is the word <q>manifest</q>. It is spoken about the ability of people to cognise. That is the creation of the world occurred <q>from that which is impossible for a person to cognise</q>, into that which is manifest, visible, which we know. And indeed, if God had not created the world, then the state of God&#39;s design for a person would be unknowable in the measure needed for them (and understandably, about the very knowledge by people, creatures, there could not be speech). The non-being of creation before its appearance, before its creation by God is inaccessible to human understanding without the Word of God, in particular also without the Revelation of God to people.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 4 — &#39;Πίστει πλείονα θυσίαν Ἄβελ παρὰ Κάϊν&#39; - &#39;pistei pleiona thysian Abel para Kain&#39; - <q>By (with) faith a greater (better) sacrifice Abel in comparison with Cain</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the accusative and indicates here comparison, juxtaposition.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 7 — &#39;εἰς σωτηρίαν τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis soterian tou oikou autou&#39; - <q>for the salvation of his house</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.  
</p>
<p>
I will stop here on verses X, 39 — XI, 7.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul here and further in the text gives examples of Old Testament and New Testament faith both in meaning and the life of various saints.
</p>
<p>
Beautiful and eloquent words, which, I think, do not require special explanations. Nevertheless, regarding the important theme of faith worthy of attention are two works with others quoted there at the links:<br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark IX, 10-16) </reading><br>
Mark IX, 10 — &#39;ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῆναι&#39; — &#39;ek nekron anastenai&#39; - <q>to rise from the dead</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here from where the transition of Christ occurred — from the dead to the living.
</p>
<p>
The question of the disciples about Elijah (John the Baptist) as the forerunner of the Coming of Christ. Also seen is the general misunderstanding by the disciples of Jesus and His mission. Nevertheless, the Lord continues to reveal to them the truth — gradually.
</p>
<p>
About the parallel place to Mark IX, 11-13 in Matthew (Matthew XVII, 10-12) see at the links:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082025.html</a><br>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Hebrews XI, 8, 11-16) </reading><br>
Hebrews XI, 8 — &#39;εἰς τόπον&#39; - &#39;eis topon&#39; - <q>to a place</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς κληρονομίαν&#39; - &#39;eis kleronomian&#39; - <q>for an inheritance</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 11 — &#39;δύναμιν εἰς καταβολὴν σπέρματος&#39; - &#39;dynamin eis katabolen spermatos&#39; - <q>power for the receiving of seed</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose, also actually joins the definition of power (<q>which power?</q>).
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 12 — &#39;ἀφ&#39; ἑνὸς&#39; - &#39;aph henos&#39; - <q>from one</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following &#39;he&#39; indicates here the origin by the maternal line. It is spoken about that Sarah gave birth, the wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac, having received seed from Abraham as father according to God&#39;s promise. And further already the lineage continued through Isaac. &#39;ὡς ἡ ἄμμος ἡ παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης ἡ ἀναρίθμητος&#39; - &#39;hos he ammos he para to kheilos tes thalasses he anarithmetos&#39; - <q>like sand to the proximity with the shore of the sea, innumerable</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the accusative and indicates here the placement of sand closer to the shore of the sea and to the sea itself.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 15 — &#39;ἀφ&#39; ἧς&#39; - &#39;aph hes&#39; - <q>from which</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following &#39;he&#39; indicates here the <q>leaving</q> of the land for the sake of God&#39;s promise, also emphasises the absence of nostalgia for the past life without God&#39;s promise in their native land (they had time to feel that nostalgia, but through their faith all that long time preserved the calling and faith, the movement toward God&#39;s promise).   
</p>
<p>
The apostle speaks about Abraham and Sarah as an example of faith, also an example of receiving promises, at the same time as an example of promises which still continue and will continue. In particular for the explanation of these latter Paul speaks about <q>the search for the Fatherland</q>, and explains that it is not spoken about Egypt or Chaldea (from where Abraham and Sarah came), where the Israelites, if they had sought it, had enough time to return. <q>Fatherland</q> here — this is literally God&#39;s Kingdom.
