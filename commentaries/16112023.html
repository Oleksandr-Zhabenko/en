<p>
The Apostle Paul calls for sobriety, vigilance, and expectation of the Second Glorious Coming of Jesus Christ. <br>
</p>
<p>
Just as the Lord Jesus Christ said that His Coming in glory would be unexpected, so Paul repeats this thought here.<br>
</p>

<reading>(Luke XVI, 1-9) </reading><br>
Luke XVI, 3 - '·ºêŒºŒø·ø¶' - 'emou' - 'me'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Parable of the Ruler of Unrighteousness is read and Jesus begins to explain it.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is a difficult parable to understand.<br>
</p>
<p>
But it can be understood if we pay attention to Jesus' explanation - the ruler forgave some of the debts of his master's debtors and showed them mercy. Christ wants the faithful to show mercy to other sinful people so that <q>sin becomes less</q>. <br>
</p>
<p>
And the very name <q>steward of unrighteousness</q> implies that everything that is good and worthy in a person is not their own, but has its origin in God. It is God who gives a person certain gifts, and only then does a person accept something truly good, have something truly good. And in this case, each person appears like a steward - they manage, but not what is their own, not what belongs to them wholly. Therefore, they manage <q>not their own wealth, but what God gives them</q>. And since this wealth is originally God's, a manifestation of God's generosity, the person has it <q>as if unrighteously</q>, i.e. undeservedly, as a gift from God. This is a state of formation, when a person has not yet become what they will be, when there is no manifest, final Kingdom of God. And when the Kingdom of God comes, after the Second Coming of Christ and the general resurrection of the dead, then the person will cease to be a <q>steward</q> but will become what they have become by God's grace and their freedom.<br>
