<p><reading>(Acts XXVII, 1-44) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts XXVII, 23  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. Used
for emphasis.</p>
<p>Acts XXVII, 33  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»ÎµÎ½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emellenâ€™  &ndash; â€˜to be about, to intend, to
be close toâ€™  &ndash; from â€˜Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜melloâ€™.</p>
<p>Acts XXVII, 41  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ¹Î½ÎµÎ½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emeinenâ€™  &ndash; â€˜remained, continuedâ€™  &ndash; from
â€˜Î¼ÎµÎ½Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜menoâ€™.</p>
<p>Part of the story of Paulâ€™s difficult journey on his way to Rome for
judgement. Here, too, the Lord shows His mercy and help in difficult
circumstances and reveals His will through Paul, as He did through the
prophets, saving people from their misfortunes. The mutual support of
Paul and the centurion Julius, his watchman, who took him to court, is
also worthy of note.</p>
<p>I would also like to draw attention to the mention of the city of
Myra of Lycia, where, by Godâ€™s will, St Nicholas the Wonderworker, also
known for helping travellers and sailors in particular, became
well-known.</p>

<p><reading>(John XVII, 18-26) </reading>
</p>
<p>John XVII, 18, 20, 23  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John XVII, 19  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myselfâ€™.</p>
<p>John XVII, 21, 23  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜emoiâ€™  &ndash; (in) â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John XVII, 21, 22  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ½â€™  &ndash; â€˜henâ€™  &ndash; <q>one, the only one, united</q> (there
is no quite good translation. The original is a singular adjective,
derived from the numeral <q>one</q> and means <q>to be one, the only one,
united</q>).</p>
<p>John XVII, 23  &ndash; the same adjective is in the accusative case, but the
meaning is more similar to the concept of <q>unity</q>.</p>
<p>John XVII, 24  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is used with emphasis.
â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; (with) â€˜Meâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î·Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emenâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™ (glory).</p>
<p>The continuation of the so-called High Priestâ€™s Prayer of Jesus
Christ at the Last Supper, its actual completion. I wrote about the
beginning of the prayer here:
<br><a class="link2" href="28052023.html">28052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The Lord prays for unity among the disciples, similar to the unity in
the Holy Trinity. Through this unity, the world should also understand
the disciples and come to know God through them. These are important
words for the Church, which is One, the One (and it is the
above-mentioned adjective that is meant here).</p>
<p>I wrote about perichoresis, the mutual presence in the Trinity, and
its direct connection with people via the links:

<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
