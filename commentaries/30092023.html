<p>(1 Corinthians XIV, 20-25) Today‚Äôs reading is preceded by the one
referred to at the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="03082023.html">03082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The continuation of today‚Äôs reading is the one referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="04082023.html">04082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>The quotation from the Law is Isaiah XXVIII, 11 (in a peculiar
version).</p>
<p>Since experience can sometimes be negative and can contribute to sin,
many Corinthians believed that it was better to be inexperienced so as
not to sin. The apostle Paul says that it is better not to have
experiences that lead, induce, teach us to sin, but rather to have
experiences of a reasonable, good, devout, godly life - and the more of
these, the better, without limitation.</p>
<p>Various good experiences, knowledge, and skills contribute to the
spread of faith, contribute to salvation, so this is one of the means
that the Lord can use to better reach out to people (indirectly through
this experience, knowledge, skills, etc.). However, unrepentant people
reject this too, if they remain unrepentant.</p>
<p>An example of rationality in faith is when prophecy is used
correctly, as well as speaking in tongues. It is immediately apparent
that God‚Äôs gifts must be used wisely for the common good and
salvation.</p>
<p>What is truly good for many or all has an advantage in the Church.
Paul‚Äôs example of a man being converted by hearing prophecy is eloquent.
There are many ways to come to faith, and it can be done in such a
miraculous manner—Ü too.</p>
<p>(Matthew XXV, 1-13) Matthew XXV, 8, 9, 11 - ‚ÄòŒ∑ŒºŒπŒΩ‚Äô - ‚Äòemin‚Äô - (to)
‚Äòus‚Äô. ‚ÄòŒ∑ŒºœâŒΩ‚Äô - ‚Äòemon‚Äô - ‚Äòus‚Äô (ours).</p>
<p>Matthew XXV, 13 - ‚ÄòŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±ŒΩ‚Äô - ‚Äòemeran‚Äô - ‚Äòday‚Äô.</p>
<p>There is a good text on the parable of the Ten Virgins in Ukrainian
at the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc----23">https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc‚Äî-23</a><br></p>
<p>I would like to say that this parable also relates to the end of the
world - it says that before the bridegroom appeared, <q>ALL the virgins
FELL ASLEEP</q>. This means that before the Second Coming happens, everyone
has to <q>fall asleep</q>. So the only question is what this means and when
they will <q>fall asleep</q>. Sleep here cannot mean physical death, because
not all people will die before the Second Coming, many will be alive at
that time. On the other hand, those who will die by then may be among
those who are meant by the virgins. But also all the people who are
alive at that time will be among those virgins, and they will also
<q>sleep</q> (and it will not be a bodily death for them). What is it
then?</p>
<p>For example, in Christianity there is a virtue called <q>sobriety</q>, the
ability to look at the spiritual in a reasonable and sober way, without
speculation, to see it in life and live according to it, the ability to
see one‚Äôs own sins and repent of them. But it is known that repentance
is to exist until the end of the world, so it is not exactly <q>sobriety</q>
in this sense that is to be left.</p>
<p>Another assumption might be one that is built around the idea of
sleep as a natural non-sinful passion. Then it is possible that all
people before the end of the world will be subject to passions to
varying degrees, including non-sinful ones. But this is very common at
all times, so it is difficult to say anything more precise in this
sense.</p>
<p>The most appropriate view is that sleep, as opposed to wakefulness,
is when the virgins could not buy oil, i.e., to do good deeds, including
works of mercy, in a good, Gospel way. Let us also recall that elsewhere
Christ says that people will seek at least one day of the Son of Man and
will not find it (apparently, there will be no explicit examples like
the ones in the Gospel, but only implicit ones). Perhaps this means that
before the Second Coming it will be increasingly difficult to do good
deeds in the Gospel spirit. But this idea is difficult to reconcile with
the belief in the power of God and God‚Äôs help to all who repent and seek
salvation.</p>
<p>There may be other options.</p>
<p>And one more thing. Even if it becomes clear what kind of <q>sleep</q> is
meant, then one must still be able to understand that this particular
sleep is common to all living people in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the thought is important, since it is in the Gospel, but
it is not yet fully understood. Verse 13 emphasises the fact that we do
not know (and will not know until the actual Second Coming takes place)
the full answer.</p>

VIII, 2; John X, 9-16) For the readings from the Apostle, see the link:
