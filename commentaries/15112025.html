it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
<reading>(2 Corinthians VIII, 1-5) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians VIII, 1 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις&#39; — &#39;en tais ekklesiais&#39; - <q>in the Churches</q>. It is meant that being in the Church, churching has important significance for receiving God&#39;s grace.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 2 — &#39;ἐν πολλῇ δοκιμῇ θλίψεως&#39; — &#39;en polle dokime thlipseos&#39; - <q>in great experience of sorrow; in great experience of oppressions; amid trials by oppressions</q>. Different variants of translation are possible, but in general the thought is clear. &#39;εἰς τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;eis to ploutos tes haplotetos auton&#39; - <q>into the wealth of their generosity</q>. It is spoken about the transformation of deep poverty through grace and the good will of people into wealth of generosity — generosity becomes rich not by the magnitude of gifts, but through sacrificial giving in difficulties.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 3 — &#39;παρὰ δύναμιν&#39; — &#39;para dynamin&#39; - <q>to the proximity with power</q>. In general it is spoken about that they manifested the power of freedom, the power of voluntariness, that is, were <q>voluntary to such extent that this became power</q>. An image of God&#39;s goodness and power — God also so much wished to save people that He manifested in this God&#39;s power in the Resurrection.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 4 — &#39;τῆς εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους&#39; — &#39;tes eis tous hagious&#39; - <q>that which is for the saints</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the directedness of the ministry, for whom it is.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul here praises to the Corinthians the Macedonians, in particular the Thessalonians, sets them as an example of generosity, with full commitment of themselves to God and manifestation of faithfulness to the apostles and other churches.
</p>
<p>
Paul emphasises that such sacrificial giving comes from God&#39;s grace, better to say — from its abundance, wealth and rejoices with them together. It is necessary to remember that everything good people, and in particular the faithful, receive through the action of God&#39;s grace, but not every gift of God is grace itself. Nevertheless, as was written earlier, the word <q>grace</q> at least sometimes in the New Testament is used in a broad sense, meaning different gifts of God, not necessarily Divine energy, which most often is called by this word in the New Testament.

<p>
<reading>(Luke VIII, 16-21) </reading><br>
Luke VIII, 17 — &#39;εἰς φανερὸν&#39; — &#39;eis phaneron&#39; - <q>into manifestness</q>. It is spoken about what will become manifest, known.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 18 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from him</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel emphasises that what is taken will be completely, fully.
