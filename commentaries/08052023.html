<p><reading>(Acts X, 1  &ndash; 16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts X, 4  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒµŒºœÜŒøŒ≤ŒøœÇ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòemphobos‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòin fear‚Äô (of
God). ‚ÄòŒµŒºœÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòemprosthen‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòbefore‚Äô (the face).</p>
<p>Cornelius the centurion and his household became an example of devout
and good pagans who became Christians, and later, at the Apostolic
Council in Jerusalem in 51 AD, this story will be mentioned by Peter as
a sign that the Lord is pleased to preach not only to Jews but also to
Gentiles.</p>
<p>The significance of the story is therefore enormous, universal, and
the vision must be understood in this context. Peter‚Äôs vision means that
non-Jews, people whom the Jews considered to be not directly called to
unity in faith with the Jews and therefore not to be the scope of their
direct preaching, mission, are in fact also called by God to participate
in the faith of the fathers, prophets, and apostles, to participate in
the Church of Christ and in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p><q>What God has cleansed, do not call (do not do) common (profane)</q> are
important words regarding the fact that the Lord has called all people
to Himself. And those called by God do not have a special advantage by
origin.</p>
<p>I also remember these words personally. After all, my surname is
Zhabenko, which derives from the word ‚Äòfrog‚Äô in Ukrainian, and frogs
were considered impure animals under the Law of Moses, and could not be
eaten by the Jews. Moreover, the Revelation mentions frogs in connection
with the devil, the Antichrist, and the false prophet  &ndash; see Revelation
XVI, 13.</p>
<p>If someone wants to see this reference as a prohibition for me to
preach, then I can answer with the words of the Holy Spirit  &ndash; <q>What God
has cleansed, do not call (do not do) common.</q></p>
<p>I am also called to the Church of Christ and the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>As for the words <q>your mercies are remembered before God</q> spoken by
the angel to Cornelius in the vision, they are parallel to the
non-canonical Old Testament book of Tobit, where the archangel Raphael
(<q>healing of God</q>) was sent by God to heal and help a family (and those
who joined it) that had shown mercy and was faithful to God.</p>

<p>John VI, 56  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒøŒπ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòemoi‚Äô  &ndash; ‚ÄòMe‚Äô.</p>
<p>John VI, 57  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒµ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòeme‚Äô  &ndash; (through) ‚ÄòMe‚Äô, (because of) ‚ÄòMe‚Äô.</p>

<p>The interpreters note that Christ did not sacrifice part of His
teaching in order to make it <q>more attractive to people</q>. If the
disciples were tempted by what He really revealed, He did not refuse
what He had revealed, the truth of God.</p>
<p>I will focus on the words <q>abide in someone</q> that the Lord uses.</p>
<p>I will not go into theology, which is a very deep topic and requires
a lot of writing, which I do not have time for now, but I will note some
of the fundamental points of these words.</p>
<p>In theology, there is a concept of <q>perichoresis</q>  &ndash; <q>someone‚Äôs being
in someone else</q>. See, for example, the English-language Wikipedia, and
there are also versions in other languages, including Dutch
(unfortunately, no Ukrainian at the moment)
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perichoresis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perichoresis</a><br>
as well as in the sources cited there.</p>
<p>See also a good essay on the Trinity at
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html</a></p>
<p>A long time ago I recorded a podcast in which I explained in detail
that God is the only One who can abide in someone, and that person does
not lose anything of his or her own, but gains God.</p>
<p>Compare, for example, with demon obsession  &ndash; a person who is obsessed
by a demon (or demons) is in him (them) by God‚Äôs permission, but (at
least partially) loses control over themselves, fulfils the desires of
those demons (at least sometimes) without being able to resist them.</p>
<p>Nor do angels abide in people, nor do people abide in angels.</p>
<p>And people do not abide in each other, except for a mother and a
child in her womb (here there is a partial abiding of one person in
another  &ndash; the child in the mother, but not vice versa  &ndash; the mother does
not abide in the child). The state of a pregnant woman with a child in
her womb is very different from the state of a woman with a child
already born, or from a woman (girl) who is not a mother.</p>
<p>And God is the Only One Whose presence in someone <q>does not take
away</q> anything essential, but only <q>adds</q>  &ndash; if God is in someone, then
that person <q>fully acquires themselves and God</q>.</p>
<p>As for the perichoresis in the Trinity, the mutual abiding of the
Hypostases (Persons) in Each Other also does not mean that They lose
anything, but means the fullness of God‚Äôs love.</p>
<p>I would also say that people, through abiding in God, can also
partially abide in each other  &ndash; in heart, in spirit, which is also
called <q>having one heart and one soul</q>, <q>being of one mind</q>, <q>having one
heart and one mouth</q>, and the like.</p>
<p>This is especially desirable for the family and for me
personally.</p>

<p>To the Apostle Mark: <br>
<reading>(1 Peter V, 6-14; Mark VI, 7-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter‚Äôs letter mentions the apostle and evangelist Mark, Peter‚Äôs
spiritual son (disciple). It is written metaphorically, but I think
there is nothing difficult in these words. For a beautiful essay on the
kiss of love, see this link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Kiss.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Kiss.html</a></p>
<p>The reading from the Gospel of Mark describes the work of the
apostles (including his own) and Jesus‚Äô instructions to them. Most of
all, we need to beware of money-loving, attachment to earthly things
(which greatly harms apostolic zeal). The words about the <q>dust</q> on
their feet mean that the apostles should not be discouraged after
people‚Äôs rejection, but should go on, and should also guard against
acquiring other sins from unbelievers. Why will <q>more tolerable it will
be for Sodom or Gomorrah</q> than for those unbelievers? Because if they
reject the apostolic preaching, Christ Himself, then what will stop them
from falling further into sins and vices? And where will true repentance
come from?</p>
<p>Therefore, all of this emphasises the importance of the apostolic
work, and in particular the ministry of the apostle and evangelist Mark
himself.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
