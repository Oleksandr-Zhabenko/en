<p><reading>(Ephesians I, 22  &ndash; II, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>A difficult theological passage that needs
explanation.</p>
<p>Ephesians II, 3  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’
(our). ‘ημεθα’  &ndash; ‘emetha’  &ndash; ‘were’.</p>
<p>Similar thoughts to Ephesians II, 3 are found in Galatians V, 16,
which is cited by the following link (the same link is also cited for
the Gospel reading below, so it is doubly necessary):
<br>
<a class="link2" href="19092023.html">19092023.html</a></p>
<p>The reading from chapter I suggests several important theological
thoughts.</p>
<p>I will focus on the logic of the construction of two verses, and then
the other points, which I will not dwell on, will be clearer.</p>
<p>In fact, verses 22-23 say that God the Father gave Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, to be the Head of the Church (compare this with what is said
in the work <q>On the Trinity</q> at
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html</a><br>
), and God (here the whole Trinity is meant, for the Father has willed
it, the Son has indeed incarnated and become a human being, and the Holy
Spirit continues to work in the Church, sanctifying it and indeed making
it the Body of the Son of God, in particular through the Sacraments,
especially the Eucharist) has made the Church the Body of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>These verses also mean that the Church has thus become <q>fullness
(completeness, a kind of</q>final destination”, the Son of God will never
leave her)” of the Son of God through His human nature, in particular
the body, but also He as God gives everything fullness, meaning,
significance, fills everything with gifts, bestows everything with what
it is (i.e. the nature of all creation is most closely, intimately
connected with the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and depends on Him), and
this is most of all not even in the creation and care of creation
(although this is prominent in the whole of God’s house-building)), but
in the Incarnation and salvation of the world.</p>
<p>In chapter II, Paul speaks of the state of creation and people before
union with Christ, the state of death, and the dominion of the devil
because of the impossibility of complete victory and the elimination of
sins. The place of residence of the evil spirits, together with their
leader, the devil, called <q>prince</q> (<q>princes</q> do not have full power),
is called <q>air</q> (given that they do not live in the spiritual heaven,
being cast down from there; people also live surrounded by air,
i.e. <q>air</q> here is the environment of human life). The translation
<q>according to the spirit</q>  &ndash; the word <q>according to</q> is not in the
original, and we can (I think also we should) simply read <q>…according to
the prince who rules in the air, {that is,} the spirit who works in the
sons of disobedience…</q>.</p>
<p>
Before the Son's of God Incarnation, the dominion of the devil, sin and death was not defeated, but the Lord Jesus Christ in His First Coming defeated the devil, sin and death, and as the Head of the Church <q> headed (became the Leader and Lord) the fullness of the ultimate victory</q> that will come at His Second Coming and He leads people to it. He is the Saviour of the world. (This paragraph was added on 26/09/2023).
</p>
<p>Verse 3 says that those who accepted Christ in adulthood had
previously lived like the Gentiles, in an environment with people and
demons (in fact, this confirms the idea that the <q>air</q> is the
environment of not only demons but also people). In fact, the Church
here confronts this very environment of <q>life (which can also be called
death) of both people and demons, in the air</q>.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark X, 46-52) </reading>
</p>
<p>Mark X, 51  &ndash; ‘θελεις’  &ndash; ‘theleis’  &ndash; (you) ‘desire’.
