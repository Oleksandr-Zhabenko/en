<p><reading>(Isaiah III, 1-14) </reading>
</p>
<p>Isaiah testifies to the state of people in sins,
to the spiritual decline of society that follows these sins. <q>prophets</q>
and <q>foretellers</q> played the same role in those days as the so-called
<q>experts</q> do today. The name has changed. A <q>smart listener</q> is a person
who takes an uncritical, <q>consumerist</q> approach to everything that is
happening, and to a certain extent feels quite comfortable in a society
in which sins are developing and morality and spirituality are
declining.</p>
<p>Again, the Old Testament people do not distinguish between God’s
permissiveness and His direct action, therefore the permissiveness is
spoken of as the direct action of God  &ndash; <q>I will make them rulers.</q></p>
<p>In fact, the direct action of God will be the judgment and victory
over all evil  &ndash; both gradual, in time, and final  &ndash; in eternity.</p>
<p>Actually, we will talk about this court later.</p>

<p>A very deep text that covers several deep
topics at once.</p>
<p>Due to lack of space, I will dwell on only a few points.</p>
<p>The article at the link helps to better understand the state of man
in Paradise:

<p>Genesis II, 24 is a classic verse quoted by Christ Himself when
speaking of the sacrament and mysterion of the Marriage. There is a good
essay on unity in marriage and fidelity (faithfullness) at the links
(the first is a more complete text, with additional analysis of various
sources, and the second is a short version):

<p>Shame is primarily a spiritual feeling, which is associated with
conscience (and is a sign of its vulnerability after the Fall), but is a
consequence of sin.</p>
<p>There are good thoughts to be considered about the Fall at the
following links:

<p>The first thing that human did wrong was that Eve said wrongly about
the commandment of God in Paradise, adding <q>do not touch</q> by herself
(compare Genesis II, 16-17 and Genesis III, 3).</p>
<p>People could no longer be in Paradise, because they sinned and did
not repent, but transferred the guilt to someone else (including even
God  &ndash; <q>which You gave me</q>). Therefore, God, by virtue of the reality of
freedom, says how sin will affect their way of existence, in the
language of theology, on the tropos. More about freedom is at the link
cited above:

<p>I still want to pay attention to such details.</p>
<p>Genesis III, 8  &ndash; <q>And they [Adam and Eve] heard the sound of the Lord
God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife
hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the
garden.</q>  &ndash; a more literal translation gives: ” And they heard the sound
(voice) of the Lord-Gods [Holy Trinity], Who (Trinity) walked in the
garden in the blowing of the wind (breath, breeze, subtle coolness) of
the day, and hid themselves  &ndash; Adam and his wife  &ndash; from the presence
(faces, in plural, Persons) of the Lord-Gods among the trees of the
garden”. I would like to note that <q>the breeze (spirit, subtle coolness,
breath) of the coolness of the day</q> is a multi-meaning expression, which
also indicates how the Lord can reveal Himself to people  &ndash; in
particular, it has many parallels. <q>Therefore do not worry about
tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for
the day is its own trouble.</q> (Matthew VI, 25-34) Here, at the same time,
there is a paradoxical idea that every time, there is always enough
worries and troubles. What is the Gospel, what is the <q>good news</q>? The
fact that these questions will all be resolved over time. This can be
seen in the fact that <q>today</q> is called the time when we worry about
something in order to solve it, about some issues, and <q>tomorrow</q> is
called the time when they are solved, and what <q>will take care of
itself</q> is said that issues are very often resolved in a way that we
cannot predict in advance, are resolved unpredictably.</p>
<p>It is even more interesting if you look at the etymology of the word
<q>tomorrow</q> in Greek (the classical language of the Gospel). It has the
same root as <q>fresh wind</q>, <q>breeze</q>. Substitute <q>breeze</q> for <q>tomorrow</q>
and you will see new nuances (I wonder if the Lord wants us to think of
these nuances as His opinion or not?). Problems and troubles are
compared to the wind, and their solution to a fresh breeze. Then it
becomes obvious that there’s no real point in <q>griefing</q> over them.”</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs III, 19-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>Proverbs III, 19 are meaningful words that can
also be understood both as an indication of the Holy Trinity, where the
Father is called the Lord, the Son is called the Wisdom of the Father,
and the Holy Spirit is the Mind (for example, Basil the Great claimed
that the Trinity during the creation of the world, acting as One
commonly and with a single action, yet had some hypostatic differences
in action, which can be seen from this verse), and as both wisdom and
reason can be thought of as the contextual synonyms, and think that it
is about how wisely God created the whole world.</p>
<p><q>may your soul live</q> is a parallel to yesterday’s reading about the
origin of man and the <q>living soul</q>. See:
<br><a class="link2" href="02032023.html">02032023.html</a></p>
<p>Proverbs III, 27-28 is a parallel place to James II, 14-26

<p>Next (verses 29-30) are the general rules of life, which can be
safely called universal, common to all humans in particular in the
modern sense of the word.</p>
<p>The translation of verse 32 is sometimes incorrect, so I quote the
literal translation: <q>For an abomination to Yahweh the perverse [person
is] but with the upright His secret counsel [is]</q>.</p>
<p><q>cursing</q> in the Old Testament is again not a sign of <q>wishing harm
and evil to someone</q>, but a sign that God does not bless such people,
but on the contrary  &ndash; acts decisively against them.</p>
<p>Verse 34 is also quoted by the apostles in the Epistles.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
