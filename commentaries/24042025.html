<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: John III, 5 — ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος - ean me tis gennethe ex hydatos kai pneumatos - unless one is born of water and the Spirit. The preposition ek in its form before the following hy indicates here that it is a matter of origin. The Apostle Paul elsewhere says: 'that which is born of the Spirit is spirit', and we also have the words that flesh and blood cannot enter the Kingdom of God. That is, we can say that in order to enter the Kingdom of God, one must receive forgiveness of sins, as well as the gift of the Holy Spirit, and become a spiritual being, a spirited being. The Apostle Paul goes on to speak of the spiritual body, which is resurrected and immortal. The point is that the way a person lives is to be transformed by God's grace, to be completely changed.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts II, 38-43) </reading><br>
Acts II, 38 — <q>εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν</q> - <q>eis aphesin ton amartion hymon</q> - <q>for the forgiveness of your sins; for the remission of your sins</q>. The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates the purpose here. Different translations are possible. An important testimony to one of the main meanings of the Sacrament of Baptism.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 39 — ‘πᾶσιν τοῖς εἰς μακρὰν’ - ‘pasin tois eis makran’ - ‘to all those into the distance’. The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates that this refers to the spread of the practice of Baptism over great distances, to everywhere. The promise of God is effective everywhere, but the practice of Baptism will spread gradually.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 40 — ‘σώθητε ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης’ - ‘sothete apo tes geneas tes skolias tautes’ - ‘be saved from this wicked (dishonest) generation’. The preposition <q>apo</q> indicates that this is a reference to total salvation, complete salvation.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 41 — <q>ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ</q> - <q>en te hemera ekeine</q> - <q>on that day</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 43 — <q>ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ</q> - <q>en Ierousalem</q> - <q>in Jerusalem</q>. Where.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(John III, 1-15) </reading><br>
John III, 1 — <q>ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων</q> - <q>ek ton Pharisaion</q> - <q>of the Pharisees</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates origin, i.e. he was a member of the group of the Pharisees, but did not share the views of their majority about Jesus. 
</p>
<p>
John III, 2 — <q>ἀπὸ θεοῦ</q> - <q>apo theou</q> - <q>from God</q>. The preposition <q>apo</q> indicates here that the coming of Christ is a gift from God to people. Nicodemus thought this way.
</p>
<p>
John III, 3 — <q>μὴ δύναται εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ δεύτερον εἰσελθεῖν καὶ γεννηθῆναι</q> - 'me dynatai eis ten koilian tes metros autou deuteron eiselthein kai gennethenai' - <q>he cannot a second time enter his mother's womb and be born'. Where to. It is important to notice Nicodemus' confidence that Christ's words cannot be understood literally, and he sees no other understanding. That is why he asks in the form of an incomplete negation. It is also interesting that the word ‘second time’ comes before both verbs “enter</q> and ‘be born’, but not before the second one. This may indicate that the Jews understood conception as the entry of a human being into the womb, although I know nothing about this.
</p>
<p>
John III, 5 — <q>ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος</q> - <q>ean me tis gennethe ex hydatos kai pneumatos</q> - <q>unless one is born of water and the Spirit</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> in its form before the following <q>hy</q> indicates here that it is a matter of origin. The Apostle Paul elsewhere says: 'that which is born of the Spirit is spirit', and we also have the words that <q>flesh and blood cannot enter the Kingdom of God</q>. That is, we can say that in order to enter the Kingdom of God, one must receive forgiveness of sins, as well as the gift of the Holy Spirit, and become a spiritual being, a spirited being. The Apostle Paul goes on to speak of the spiritual body, which is resurrected and immortal. The point is that the way a person lives is to be transformed by God's grace, to be completely changed.

 'οὐ δύναται εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν' — 'ou dynatai eiselthein eis ten basileian ton ouranon' - 'cannot enter the Kingdom of God'. See the explanation above.
</p>
<p>
John III, 6 — 'τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς σάρξ ἐστιν, καὶ τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος πνεῦμά ἐστιν' - <q>to gegennemenon ek tes sarkos sarx estin kai to gegennemenon ek tou pneumatos pneuma estin</q> - 'what is born of the flesh, is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit'. See just above. The preposition <q>ek</q> here indicates origin.
</p>
<p>
John III, 8 — <q>οὕτως ἐστὶν πᾶς ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος</q> - <q>outos estin pas ho gegennemenos ek tou pneumatos</q> - <q>This manner is everyone who is born of the Spirit</q>. See above.
</p>
<p>
John III, 13 — <q>εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν</q> - <q>eis ton ouranon</q> - <q>into the heaven</q>. Where to. 'ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ' - <q>ek tou ouranou</q> - <q>from the heaven</q>. From where. 'ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ' - ‘en to ourano’ - ‘in the heaven’. Where.
</p>
<p>
John III, 14 — <q>ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ</q> - <q>en te eremo</q> - <q>in the wilderness</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
John III, 15 — ‘ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων ἐν αὐτῷ ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον’ - ‘hina pas ho pisteuon en auto ekhe zoen aionion’ - ''so that everyone, who believes, in Him may have eternal life; so that everyone, who believes, with Him may have eternal life; so that everyone, who believes, may have eternal life in Him; that everyone, who believes, with Him may have eternal life'. There are four possible translations, all of which are different from the words <q>whoever believes in Him</q>. For this expression it would have to be <q>eis auton</q>. See more at this link and others cited there:<br>

The forms with <q>with Him</q> seem less appropriate, especially the fourth, but we must remember that all true virtues are a gift from God and are accomplished through the work of grace, and grace is Christ's and represents Him.
