He names first of all that which is connected with the volitional sphere of the human being. That is, he notes that the rebuke caused a strong volitional reaction. The apostle was concerned that a wrong attitude towards sin would lead to demotivation of life in Christ, to cooling of love, which Christ warns about in the Gospels. And the volitional reaction of the Corinthians showed their motivation, their sincere deep desire to continue living piously and devoutly in Christ, and those who sinned ‚Äî to repent. Therefore, that sin did not diminish the motivation of the Corinthians, that is, did not defile their will. Therefore Paul speaks of purity.

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written ‚Äî one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms ‚Äî or more rarely ‚Äî denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

to keep the version of the text current and in future.
</p>
<p>
Since yesterday was a great feast on a weekday, the daily reading was postponed to today, which is why there are two of them today. I present both together in brackets.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians VII, 10-16; 1 Corinthians I, 26-29) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians VII, 10 ‚Äî &#39;Œµ·º∞œÇ œÉœâœÑŒ∑œÅŒØŒ±ŒΩ&#39; ‚Äî &#39;eis soterian&#39; - <q>unto salvation; for salvation; to be saved</q>. The last translation is more understandable and more transparent. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose of the action here.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 11, 16 ‚Äî &#39;·ºêŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑ·Ω∂&#39; - &#39;en panti&#39; - <q>in all</q>. Here is a place that needs to be looked at more deeply. Paul rebuked the Corinthians regarding the sins of one of them and their wrong reaction, and here he writes what the Corinthians did in response to the rebuke. It must be said immediately that the words of the apostle Paul cannot be understood <q>in general</q>, for any rebuke. Many cases are well known when precisely those who were indeed guilty showed exactly what Paul here calls <q>proof of purity in the matter</q>. That is, in general, all this is not proof of innocence in something. But why does the apostle write this way here? The logic is indeed deeper in this case. He names first of all that which is connected with the volitional sphere of the human being. That is, he notes that the rebuke caused a strong volitional reaction. The apostle was concerned that a wrong attitude towards sin would lead to demotivation of life in Christ, to <q>cooling of love</q>, which Christ warns about in the Gospels. And the volitional reaction of the Corinthians showed their motivation, their sincere deep desire to continue living piously and devoutly in Christ, and those who sinned ‚Äî to repent. Therefore, that sin did not diminish the motivation of the Corinthians, that is, did not <q>defile</q> their will. Therefore Paul speaks of <q>purity</q>. An important place, since it also shows how true repentance manifests itself in many cases.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 13 ‚Äî &#39;·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ&#39; - &#39;apo panton hymon&#39; - <q>from all of you</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises the dedication of the Corinthians-addressees of the letter in spiritual communion with Titus.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 14 ‚Äî &#39;·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØ·æ≥&#39; - &#39;en aletheia&#39; - <q>in truth; with truth</q>. How. Rather the first, since it is more logical and grammatically more correct in English.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 15 ‚Äî &#39;Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ΩëŒº·æ∂œÇ&#39; - &#39;eis hymas&#39; - <q>(in movement; when he remembers about) towards you</q>. It is meant, <q>movements of the heart</q>, that is, a figurative expression about the gradual rapprochement of Titus and the Corinthians.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VII, 16 ‚Äî &#39;Œ∏Œ±œÅœÅ·ø∂ ·ºêŒΩ ·ΩëŒº·øñŒΩ&#39; - &#39;tharro en hemin&#39; - <q>bold in you; of good cheer in you</q>. It is about trust and reliability, therefore by meaning the translation will be <q>to rely on you; to be in good cheer in you</q>.
</p>
<p>
Verse 12 ‚Äî it is meant ‚Äî Paul did not try to become a party to the conflict, tries to maintain impartiality, unbiasedness, criticism.
</p>
<p>
And further Paul praises Titus and the Corinthians for the comfort shown and good behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Mark II, 18-22; Matthew XX, 29-34) </reading><br>
Mark II, 19 ‚Äî &#39;·ºêŒΩ ·æß&#39; - &#39;en ho&#39; - <q>in them</q>. The preposition <q>in</q> emphasises the value of the bridegroom as a priceless treasure.
</p>
<p>
Mark II, 20 ‚Äî &#39;·ºÄœÄ&#39; Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ&#39; - &#39;ap auton&#39; - <q>from them</q>. The preposition &#39;ap&#39; (form of &#39;apo&#39; before the next vowel) emphasises that the bridegroom will be taken away completely, entirely. &#39;·ºêŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩ·øÉ œÑ·øá ·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥&#39; - &#39;en ekeine te hemera&#39; - <q>in those days</q>. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Mark II, 21 ‚Äî &#39;·ºÄœÄ&#39; Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶&#39; - &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from it</q>. <q>The new tears away from the old</q>, that is, the Lord does not elevate in importance the old or the new, but their wholeness. In the case of the apostles this is obvious.
</p>
<p>
Mark II, 22 ‚Äî &#39;Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºÄœÉŒ∫Œø·Ω∫œÇ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœçœÇ&#39; - &#39;eis askous palaious&#39; - <q>into old wineskins</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Three short parables (images for contemplation and knowledge) regarding fasting and the state of Christ&#39;s disciples, when He is with them.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of the first comparison (with the guests) is quite transparent.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the patch and wineskins ‚Äî the Lord means that between the old attitude towards piety (ritual) and the Gospel there are noticeable differences, so that it is impossible to <q>contain</q> both well. And since the disciples are called to renewal in Christ, in the New Testament, Christ in no way demands from them that which might even harm them in this main thing. A good example also for gradual learning of the new life together with Christ ‚Äî one needs to prepare for renewal, and not <q>reformatting</q> the old. For true virtue is not a <q>reformatted</q> old way of life, which was not virtuous.
</p>
<p>
Therefore Christ in this way protects the disciples from the rebukes of the Pharisees.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 29 ‚Äî &#39;·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ ·ºπŒµœÅŒµŒπœá·Ωº&#39; - &#39;apo Iereikho&#39; - <q>from Jericho</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that they were leaving Jericho, going further.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 30 ‚Äî &#39;œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ΩÅŒ¥œåŒΩ&#39; - &#39;para ten hodon&#39; - <q>to closeness with the road</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the accusative and indicates that those two blind men sat closer to the road earlier, so that people would pay attention to them (their alms depended on it).
</p>
<p>
I wrote earlier, the words and requests of the blind are actually the Gospel record of the Jesus Prayer, because <q>Son of David</q> ‚Äî this is the Messiah, Christ, therefore, actually, the Jesus Prayer combines the request of the blind, Peter&#39;s confession and the publican&#39;s prayer (combines all three, encompassing very much).
