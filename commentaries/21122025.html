it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
Sunday before the Nativity of Christ:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews XI, 9-10, 17-23, 32-40) </reading><br>
Hebrews XI, 9 — &#39;εἰς γῆν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας&#39; — &#39;eis gen tes epangelias&#39; - <q>into the Land of Promise</q>. Here by meaning <q>he moved as a stranger into the Land of Promise</q>. &#39;ἐν σκηναῖς&#39; - &#39;en skenais&#39; - <q>in tents</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 18 — &#39;ἐν Ἰσαὰκ&#39; — &#39;en Isaak&#39; - <q>in Isaac</q>. In whom.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 19 — &#39;ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγείρειν&#39; — &#39;ek nekron egeirein&#39; - <q>from the dead to raise; to resurrect from the dead</q>. A common expression with such meaning. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates that from where the transition occurs in this — from the dead to the living. &#39;ἐν παραβολῇ&#39; - &#39;en parabole&#39; - <q>in an (proto)type</q>. That is, Abraham <q>received Isaac as a figure (image, prototype) of Christ, the Descendant</q>, therefore it is possible with regard to this to say also <q>prefigure</q>, <q>prototype</q>, although this word itself is not in the text.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 23 — &#39;ὑπὸ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;hypo ton pateron autou&#39; - <q>by his parents</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; is here with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the verb <q>was hidden</q> (the child was hidden by the parents). The word order is interesting: faith was shown by the parents, but it is written as if it were the faith of Moses. Also this has relation to the Baptism of infants — for whom their godparents confess the faith. Analogously to what is written about Moses here: <q>By faith that person, still being an infant, was baptised</q>.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 34 — &#39;ἐδυναμώθησαν ἀπὸ ἀσθενείας&#39; — &#39;edynamothesan apo astheneias&#39; - <q>were strengthened from infirmities</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here indicates complete healing, deliverance from infirmities. &#39;ἰσχυροὶ ἐν πολέμῳ&#39; - &#39;iskhyroi en polemo&#39; - <q>strong in war</q>.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 35 — &#39;ἐξ ἀναστάσεως&#39; — &#39;ex anastaseos&#39; - <q>from resurrection</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that the resurrection served as the cause and source of life for the dead, otherwise their new life would not have occurred at all.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 37 — &#39;ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρης ἀπέθανον&#39; — &#39;en phono makhaires apethanon&#39; - <q>were killed by sword</q>. &#39;ἐν μηλωταῖς, ἐν αἰγείοις δέρμασιν&#39; - &#39;en melotais, en aigeiois dermasin&#39; - <q>in sheep skins, in goat skins</q>.
</p>
