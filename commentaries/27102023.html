<p><reading>(Colossians II, 1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>Colossians II, 4  &ndash; ‘πιθανολογια’ -
‘pithanologia’  &ndash; ‘persuasive speech’ (in persuasive language).</p>
<p>Colossians II:5  &ndash; ειμι  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used for
emphasis.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says that although he is absent in body, he supports
the faith of the Colossians and the Laodiceans, including those who have
never seen Paul in person.</p>
<p>The important thing is that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of
wisdom. This means that all wisdom, all that cannot be easily gained
from experience or mere knowledge, all that is important and essential,
must be sought in Christ. And what lies beneath the surface, what is
easy to see and obvious, a person can see and know by virtue of their
natural abilities. This latter also happens with the participation of
Christ, but implicitly, so that the person themselves may not know it
until God reveals it, at least at the Last Judgement.</p>
<p>Indeed, all truly deep knowledge, cognition, wisdom is in Christ,
although it may be <q>hidden</q>, i.e. it needs to be discovered, and this
discovery is impossible unless God gives it and people cooperate with
God in this. But when such a discovery occurs, it means that God reveals
and people cooperate with God, and it cannot be otherwise. And this is
directly related to the Incarnate Son of God.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XI, 23-26) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke XI, 23  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘me’.</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterday’s reading, with which verse 23 has
in common. For more information about that reading, as well as about
that verse, please follow this link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="26102023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">26102023.html</a></p>
<p>The parable in the context of the Pharisees’ accusations about the
unclean spirit in Jesus has the understanding that the <q>swept and
cleaned house</q> may well be the Pharisees themselves, or more generally,
those called by God who deliberately reject Christ. Then there is
nothing that could prevent even worse unclean spirits from acting on
that environment and on each such person in particular, which is what
the parable is figuratively saying. At the same time, this particular
understanding is fully generalisable to the case of any deliberate
rejection of Jesus Christ and God in general. In this case, the <q>empty
house</q> means the absence of a power that would not only stop but also
drive out the evil spirits so that they do not take over the <q>house</q>,
i.e. people. In the case of the <q>house that is swept away</q>, only God’s
restraint and mercy prevents even worse than the parable says (there are
actually many more demons than seven).</p>
<p>Therefore, the parable is a warning for everyone, as well as a call
to alertness and vigilance, so that <q>the enemy does not secretly dig up
the house</q>, as it is said elsewhere.</p>
<p>To the Martyr Nestor of Thessalonica:<br>
<reading>(Ephesians VI, 10-17; Luke XXI,
12-19) </reading><br>
 Ephesians VI, 12  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; (to) ‘us’.</p>
<p>Ephesians VI, 13  &ndash; ‘ημερα’  &ndash; ‘emera’  &ndash; ‘day’ (‘on’).</p>
