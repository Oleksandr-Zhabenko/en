<p><reading>(Romans XIV, 6-9) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans XIV, 6  &ndash; ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; (at) ‘a
day’.</p>
<p>Romans 14:7  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; (of) ‘us’.</p>
<p>In fact, a continuation of the reading I wrote about here;
<br>
<a class="link2" href="26022023.html">26022023.html</a></p>
<p>Here Paul teaches us to accept diversity in what is diverse by God’s
will. For example, the fondness of the calendar  &ndash; some people are
interested in dates and events, while others take them simply. Both
options, and all those in between, are good if they are done in
accordance with God’s commandments and God’s will.</p>
<p>Verses 7-8 are difficult to translate correctly. Literally, <q>none of
us lives to ourselves (by ourselves, for ourselves)… nor dies to
ourselves (by ourselves, for ourselves)… when we live, we live to the
Lord (by the Lord, for the Lord), and when we die, we die to the Lord
(by the Lord, for the Lord)…</q>. Generally speaking, we can understand
that human beings do not live by their own strength, but that the life
of every human being is a gift from God. Likewise, all people have God’s
commandment and God’s will to preserve life. And God has all the power
to give life and to take life or to let people die.</p>
<p>How does this idea relate to the previous discussion of days and
events? It is a general recognition that the Lord has power over
everything  &ndash; He gives life, He permits people to die, He can judge
people, He can save and be merciful. He can determine events or permit
them to happen.</p>
<p>Here it is important to remember God’s care, which I wrote about
recently:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>
<p>It is also important to remember about human freedom:

<p><reading>(Matthew XV, 32-39) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 32  &ndash; ‘ημεραι’  &ndash; ‘emerai’ -
‘days’.</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 33  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 34  &ndash; ‘ιχθυδια’  &ndash; ‘ihthydia’  &ndash; ‘little fishes’.</p>
<p>Matthew XV, 36  &ndash; ‘ιχθυας’  &ndash; ‘ihthyas’  &ndash; ‘fishes’.</p>
<p>The miracle of the feeding of four thousand men, in addition with
women and children, with seven loaves of bread and a few (small)
fish.</p>
<p>It is similar to another where the Lord fed more than five thousand
men and their women and children.</p>
<p>It shows God’s care for us, and, as I wrote earlier, God’s generosity
and economy at the same time.</p>
<p>I quote:</p>
<p>” He is economical because He fed the people with a small amount of
starter food, and generous because He fed them fully, generously,
abundantly. God’s grace often works in a similar way  &ndash; God gives it
generously, but at the same time to a certain extent.”</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
