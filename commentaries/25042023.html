<p><reading>(Acts IV, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>Various Jewish elders, in particular the Sadducees,
came together against the apostles. It must be said that at that time it
was the Sadducees who made up the top of the Jewish clergy, and they
denied belief in the resurrection of the dead in general, and in
particular the Resurrection of Jesus, which was exactly what the
apostles preached.</p>
<p>The miracle served as a sign of the truth of the Resurrection of
Jesus Christ from the dead, the power of His name, so the Sadducees
rebelled against Him and the apostles. That is, it is not a matter of
their inclination or certain preferences, but of a deep confidence (and
in fact disbelief) in the fact that the dead do not rise, and therefore,
Christ did not rise. Their disbelief is revealed both by the Scriptures
and by the reality of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which the
apostles witnessed. In order to imagine the moral condition of these
elder people, it is enough to say that they did not believe in bliss
after death, did not believe in resurrection, therefore they sought
every possible reward from the fulfillment of Godâ€™s will only here, in
temporary life, and found only partially. Therefore, they did not have
such a strong faith. Mostly only the established form remained  &ndash; worship
and rites, because the Jerusalem temple still existed.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit through Peter testifies that the miracle happened in
the name of the Risen Jesus Christ, whom the Jews (and in particular the
Sadducees) crucified with the hands of the pagans.</p>

<p>John III, 21  &ndash; <q>does (creates) the truth</q>  &ndash; it is
necessary to remember that the truth is a higher virtue and value on a
par with love (<q>love rejoices with the truth</q> (1 Corinthians XIII, 6)),
cognition of the truth (and being in it) is higher than salvation and is
a manifestation of the perfection of creation. See, in particular, at

<p>The Lord became a human out of love, not to judge the world, but to
save people. This thought is very well-known and widespread, so I will
not dwell on it now. The rest of the reading is well written in the
links above.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
