it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts III, 11-16) </reading><br>
Acts III, 15 — ‘ὃν ὁ θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν’ - ‘hon ho theos egeiren ek nekron’ - <q>Whom God raised (resurrected) from the dead</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates from where the transition took place - from the dead to the living.

<p>
<reading>(John III, 22-33) </reading><br>
John III, 22 — <q>εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν γῆν</q> - <q>eis ten Ioudaian gen</q> - <q>into the land of Judea</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
John III, 23 — ‘ἐν Αἰνὼν ἐγγὺς τοῦ Σαλείμ’ - ‘en Ainon engys tou Saleim’ - ‘in Aenon near Salim’. Where. 
</p>
<p>
John III, 24 — ‘εἰς τὴν φυλακὴν’ - ‘eis ten phylaken’ - ‘into the prison; into the jail’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
John III, 25 — <q>ἐγένετο οὖν ζήτησις ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν Ἰωάννου μετὰ Ἰουδαίου</q> - <q>egeneto oun zetesis ek ton matheton Ioannou meta Ioudaiou</q> - <q>then there was a question between the disciples of John and the Jews</q>. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates here that John's disciples initiated the dispute because they understood the issue of purification differently, following John's teaching.
</p>
<p>
John III, 27 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ’ - ‘ek tou ouranou’ - ‘from the heaven’. From where. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates the origin of the possibilities - the good possibilities themselves originate from God, Who is here called <q>the heaven</q> in the sense that the heaven <q>represents</q> God, since in the spiritual heaven everything is done according to God's volition.
</p>
<p>
John III, 31 — <q>ἐκ τῆς γῆς</q> - <q>ek tes ges</q> - <q>from the earth; from the earth</q>. It is used here three times in a row. This identity with itself indicates a certain permanence of what is earthly. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates origin. 'ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ' - ‘ek tou ouranou’ - ‘from the heaven’. Here (in comparison with verse 27 above) the immediate meaning is <q>from God</q> (the Father), since <q>coming from the heaven</q> is possible only when God sends, and then not from the heaven, but from Himself. In this sense of verses 27 and 31, creations can be ‘from heaven’ (in the sense of being given as gifts and fruits, e.g., the results of God's grace), but only the One sent by the Father can ‘come from the heaven’, and this is not an angel, but the Lord, Christ. Angels do not <q>come from the heaven</q> but appear, manifest.
