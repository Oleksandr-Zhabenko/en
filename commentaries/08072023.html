<p>To the Venerable Martyr Fevronia, virgin: (2 Corinthians VI, 1-10;
Luke VII, 36-50) For the Gospel reading, see (Saint Fevronia as an
example of great love in suffering):

<p>As for the readings from the Apostle, Paul writes about the apostolic
work, with many challenges but with many fruits, and the Saint Venerable
Martyr in her virtuous life and suffering for Christ resembled this
work.</p>

<p><reading>(Romans VIII, 14-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>There is a good work about the Spirit and the
spirit at the following link:

<p>Adoption to God is a key theological point about the purpose of human
beings  &ndash; what they were created for  &ndash; that we all may become children of
God by grace as a gift from the Father to creation through the Son in
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>That is why Jesus Christ, along with the <q>Only Begotten</q> (as the only
Son of God by nature), is also called the <q>Firstborn</q> (born the First
among brothers and sisters who also became Godâ€™s children, but by grace,
through the gift of adoption to God).</p>
<p>The anticipation of creation for the manifestation of the glory of
God in the resurrection and the glory itself can best be seen in the
Risen Jesus Christ. I wrote about this earlier, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="16042023.html">16042023.html</a></p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IX, 9-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>The calling of the apostle Matthew, a former tax
collector for the Romans. Also Jesusâ€™ explanation of why He was often
among sinful people, whereas the Pharisees believed that this made a
person sinful and impure. The quotation from Hosea, which was mentioned
earlier in the question about good works on the Sabbath, shows that God
is looking for the repentance of sinners and through that their
salvation in Christ, whereas the Pharisees believed that God was looking
for the observance of all the requirements of the Law of Moses. For
Christ, people are important, but for the Pharisees, the Law is
important. We can also see that Christ is acting out of great love,
whereas the Pharisees are acting out of habit or tradition. And,
according to Paul, the Pharisees <q>did not find righteousness, because
they did not seek it by faith (values, and here the value is people
themselves, their salvation and conversion), but by deeds (certain
prescriptions).</q></p>
<p>The Lord sets an example for us.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
