<p><reading>(Acts X, 34  &ndash; 43) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts X, 40  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï†Î±Î½Î·â€™  &ndash; â€˜emphaneâ€™  &ndash; <q>to appear in,
to become manifest in</q>.</p>
<p>The reading contains the preaching of the Apostle Peter about Jesus
Christ and all the events witnessed by the apostles and many people.</p>
<p>The apostle begins with praise, which is common in apostolic
preaching. This often distinguished the preaching of the apostles from
that of the prophets. In general, we can say that the apostles testify
to Godâ€™s work among people and to their evangelism, and then proclaim
the joy of the coming of Jesus and the salvation that came to people
through Him.</p>
<p><q>God does not look at the face (appearance)</q>  &ndash; because God
continuously gifts people (cf:
<br><a class="link2" href="06042023.html">06042023.html</a><br> ), God
does not look at the differences that people use to emphasise their
individuality, meaning that He accepts and loves people of different
nationalities.</p>
<p>Peter mentions that the story of Jesus is known to many, but he
testifies that not everyone accepts  &ndash; and what Christian faith is all
about.</p>
