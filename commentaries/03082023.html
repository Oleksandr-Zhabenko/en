<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XIV, 6-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XIV, 8  - endash ‚ÄòŒ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒªŒøœÇ‚Äô  - endash ‚Äòadelos‚Äô
- <q>unknown, secret, secret, obscure</q>.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XIV, 11  - endash ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒøŒπ‚Äô  - endash ‚Äòemoi‚Äô  - endash <q>me</q>.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of the gift of speaking in tongues. I wrote about it
earlier, here I present it briefly.</p>
<p>I quote something rewritten: ‚Äù On the day of Pentecost, the saint
apostles received the gift of speaking in different languages, that is,
without learning, they could preach in the languages of the nations to
which they went with the good news of Christ. But when Paul speaks of
the Corinthians who had the gift of speaking in languages, he is talking
about uttering different sounds under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
These sounds could have a more musical character, from which melodies
could be born, in particular for prayers, psalms, liturgy. And states of
admiration could be a way of expression, joy, elation, etc. They
occurred unexpectedly without the will of the person themselves, but if
they occurred at least once in someone, they could occur again many
times in the future. That is why the apostle speaks of ten thousand
words in tongues, although the glossolalia were never too verbose. Many
Christians considered these sounds as similar to the languages of
angels, which also communicate with each other. In the previous chapter,
the apostle mentions the languages of angels. For many outsiders such
glossolalia could be estimated ambiguously.</p>
<p>The state of musical or poetic inspiration of contemporaries, when a
person consciously creates beautiful works without significant effort,
can be considered the most suitable for real glossolalia. However, it
differs from it by purpose and immediacy of the work of the Holy Spirit.
‚Äù</p>
<p>I wrote earlier about the gift of tongues for the apostles on the day
of Pentecost:
<br><a class="link2" href="04062023.html">04062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Paul emphasizes a certain <q>instrumental character</q> of the gift of
speaking in tongues. It is not an end in itself for Christians, but is
called to strengthen faith, increase joy, create songs, glorify God,
encourage and strengthen each other.</p>
<p>Also, see a nice article about antimony at the following links:

<p><q>Prayer with the spirit and understanding</q> is a combination of prayer
(and spiritual actions), which is a gift from God (and therefore it is
created <q>as if by itself, without effort</q>) with meaningful prayer and
the efforts of the person themselves.</p>
<p><q>Five words</q> ‚Äî initially, that is something that builds listeners and
speakers. For example, some good experience of learning a virtue or
fulfilling a commandment.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XX, 17-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XX, 19  - endash ‚ÄòŒµŒºœÄŒ±ŒπŒæŒ±Œπ‚Äô  - endash ‚Äòempaixai‚Äô  - endash <q>to
mock</q>.</p>
<p>Matthew XX, 23  - endash ‚ÄòŒµŒºŒøŒΩ‚Äô  - endash ‚Äòemon‚Äô  - endash <q>My</q>.</p>
<p>For the third time, Jesus reveals to the disciples about His future
Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection. They do not understand,
but the mother of two disciples close to Jesus, Solomia (a saint
myrrh-bearing woman, a relative of the Mother of God), asks Jesus for a
special privilege, a special honour for her two sons.</p>
<p><q>It is not Mine to give, but to whom it is prepared,</q>  - endash most often
people think that these two most honourable places among people, besides
Jesus, belong to‚Ä¶ the Mother of God and John the Baptist. In particular,
such an opinion is visible in many iconostases and in the
characteristics that Scripture has for them.</p>
<p>The Lord teaches Christians not to be ambitious, not to want to be
<q>the first Christians.</q></p>
