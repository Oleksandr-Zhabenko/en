<p><reading>(Romans IX, 6-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans IX, 11  &ndash; ‘προθεσις’  &ndash; ‘prothesis’  &ndash; ‘laid
before (in particular, the bread of the offering in the temple)’. It is
often understood that God chose Jacob, and that is why he really became
a saint. But the fact is that God knew that Jacob would be a saint, knew
how he would use and exercise his freedom, so without restricting human
freedom in any way, God foresaw who should be called and established.
That is why the promises were given to those people for whom they were
important. See:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="03042023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">03042023.html</a></p>
<p>This is a general opinion.</p>
<p>Romans IX, 13  &ndash; ‘εμισησα’  &ndash; ‘emisesa’  &ndash; ‘hated’  &ndash; from ‘μισεω’ -
‘miseo’  &ndash; ‘to hate’ (i.e. showed less love). Here it is <q>less honoured</q>
rather than <q>hated</q>, because God does not hate His creation, but cares
for it. Nevertheless, the blessing was given more to Jacob than to the
elder Esau.</p>
<p>Romans IX, 15 is a difficult passage to translate accurately. It is
closest in meaning to: <q>I will show mercy on whom it may be shown, and I
will show compassion on whom it may be shown.</q> See also more about this:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="06062023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">06062023.html</a></p>
<p>It is about the promises of God. God promises something important to
people, not because they want it or strive for it, but because He is
Merciful and Loving; God promises not because of people’s deeds, but as
a gift, nevertheless, to those who can keep these promises and for whom
they will really matter.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew X, 32-36, XI, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew X, 32, 33  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; <q>Me</q>
(in the original:<br>
<reading>(in) </reading><br>
 <q>Me</q>). ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before the
face, before’.</p>
<p>On the confession, see the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="11062023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">11062023.html</a></p>
<p>Regarding family and Christ  &ndash; often people put their family, or
rather their interests related to their close ones, above God, in which
case they will hinder their Christian life and/or faith. This is the
situation the Lord is talking about here. There may also be other
priorities that people put before God, with the same result. The rest of
the passage is not read here, but in it Christ says what is right in
this case.</p>
