<p>Glory be to Jesus Christ!
<br>ðŸŒžðŸ’™ðŸ’›</p>
<p>From today the Easter cycle begins, which will last 20 weeks (sorry, I wrote 21 by mistake yesterday, actually from Easter to Pentecost there are 7 weeks (7*7=49)).</p>
<p>There were 2 readings today, one of which was for St. Anthony the Great.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XII, 13-17) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Gospel we read about <q>Caesar's give to Caesar, and God's  -&ndash; to God</q> in Mark, we recently analyzed the text.</p>

<p><reading>(1 Peter  II, 21  &ndash; III, 9) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Apostle it was read:</p>
<p>1) about patience in suffering for Christ, and about the feat of Jesus Himself for our salvation,</p>
<p>2) about the relationship between husbands and wives.</p>
<p>1) <q>called to that</q>  &ndash; not called to suffering, but to loyalty to God, to love that even suffering cannot break, destroy, violate. But if someone does not have Jesus in front of their spiritual eyes, then for such a person, although it is possible to recognize a possible feat of patience for the sake of good, it is difficult to have real firmness and faithfulness in this, because <q>you were like those sheep that wandered.</q></p>
<p>2) a voluminous topic, we partially touched on it earlier, considering similar thoughts of Paul. Due to lack of space, I will not dwell on everything in detail, I will note that Peter emphasizes the joint-heiring of women and men in grace (and implicitly  &ndash; the equality and equal dignity of both sexes).</p>
<p><q>there were no obstacles to your (joint) prayers</q>  &ndash; hence the rule that one should live in such a way that it does not harm prayer, in particular joint prayer. That which interferes with prayer, which cannot be directed in the direction of God, should be bypassed, or even we should struggle against it. Each person judges (thinks, reason) about this most often according to conscience, therefore it is desirable that husbands and wives have commonality, similarity.</p>
<p>1 Peter III, 1  &ndash; <q>were captured by the behavior of the wife</q>  &ndash; rather, certainly, <q>overcomed</q>, i.e. first of all <q>impressed</q> (not necessarily emotionally, but significantly), i.e. the behavior must be <q>glorious</q> according to the biblical understanding of glory.</p>

<p>And further in relation to everyone â€” community and unity in good is a great value that must be sought, protected and multiplied.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
