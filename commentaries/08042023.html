<p><reading>(Hebrews XII, 28  &ndash; XIII, 8) </reading>
</p>
<p>Hebrews XII, 28  &ndash; there is a good work
about the Elder of God at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/BesidaNaSlovaCHrystaStrakh.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/BesidaNaSlovaCHrystaStrakh.html</a></p>
<p>Hebrews XIII, 2  &ndash; it is about Abraham and Lot, we discussed earlier.
<br><a class="link2" href="30032023.html">30032023.html</a></p>
<p>I will also note that in the original, the first two verses of the
chapter have the root ‘φιλο’  &ndash; friendly, brotherly (sisterly) love,
built on commonality. <q>Brotherly love</q> is such love for loved ones and
accomplices, <q>hospitality</q>  &ndash; for <q>strangers</q> and newcomers, and in
general  &ndash; if possible, general.</p>
<p>Hebrews XIII, 3  &ndash; memory not only of prisoners in the literal sense,
but of all those who suffer, because the faithful also have different
sufferings and difficulties now compared to eternity. The text does not
imply that the human body is like a prison, but that the present life
has sufferings as well as joys.</p>
<p>Hebrews XIII, 4  &ndash; <q>honourable marriage</q> — that is, unique, special,
outstanding, respected, better than beautiful, which is a special unique
value, etc.. <q>Fornicators and adulterers will be judged by God</q> is a
parallel to the words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew V,
27-32; also: XIX, 4-9). There are good works about it at the following
links:

BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%96%D1%8F.html (longer
version)</p>
<p>Hebrews XIII, 5  &ndash; <q>Without love of money in the way of life, be
satisfied with those (life’s goods) that are near, that come</q>  &ndash; because
<q>the Lord is near.</q> For a faithful person, the Lord is the source of
constant joy, you can always praise Him, glorify Him, thank Him, sing
for Him. The meaning is not that a person should always be satisfied
with what he or she has (otherwise he / she will not strive for more and
develop), but that the Lord is always close, and the benefits of life
should be used <q>in time</q>, rejoice in them <q>here and now</q>, ” when they
are near and coming,” without being attached (addicted) to their number,
without becoming dependent on them. For example, if you have delicious
food, eat in moderation, pray and thank God. Also, try to discover God’s
love for your neighbours.</p>
<p>The attitude to life should be <q>courageous in the Lord.</q></p>
<p>Paul also mentions mentors and following their faith in
reverence.</p>
<p>And Christ is always Himself.</p>

<p><reading>(John XI, 1-45) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading is long and rich in various details, if
you dwell on them in detail, then as John the Theologian writes in
another place  &ndash; <q>and the world itself would not contain the written
books</q> (John XXI, 25).</p>
<p>Therefore, I will only briefly comment on some important details in
order.</p>
<p>Lazarus, Martha and Mary are close friends of Jesus. Ones of my
beloved saints.</p>
<p>What is known about Mary. There were many Marys (besides the Mother
of God, at least Mary Magdalene, my beloved saint, Mary, the sister of
Lazarus, about whom we read here, Mary of James, who are all
myrrh-bearers), John specifies which Mary exactly. Readers (students of
John) know about her or even her herself.</p>
<p>Twelve hours a day is the vernal equinox (an indirect indication of
the date of the event). In the image of light and walking, Jesus speaks
of the constant struggle between good and evil. And teaches courage in
(regarding) good.</p>
<p>Thomas’ words show his courage and devotion to Jesus. And the
reasoning on the topic is that the apostles thought that Jesus was
<q>gathering forces</q> to go with them to Jerusalem to seize power.</p>
<p>The respect from the Jews for the family of Lazarus is noticeable.
Which also shows their piety.</p>
<p>Martha’s faith. Her confession. Christ’s words about Himself. Key in
many ways. John XI, 25  &ndash; <q>Me</q>  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’.</p>
<p>Jesus’ words remind Martha of Mary—and she calls out to her in Jesus’
name. Evidently, Mary loved to listen to Jesus, including His high
words. Marta herself was <q>more down-to-earth.</q></p>
<p>Confession of Mary. Both sisters have a common faith in Jesus, but
the manifestations of their love are different.</p>
<p>Mention that Jesus wept (out of love and compassion).</p>
<p>The miracle of resurrection. Christ carries out the event itself in
such a way as to teach us.</p>
