<p><reading>(Acts XII, 25  &ndash; XIII, 12) </reading>
</p>
<p>The story of the beginning of the common
ministry of Saul (Paul), Barnabas and John, also called Mark (the future
evangelist). Also, the story of the miraculous blinding of a magician
who opposed the preaching of Christ (two magicians are mentioned by
name, it is not clear whether they are the same man with two names or
two different ones).</p>
<p>Saul (Paul), in the Holy Spirit, looked attentively <q>into</q> Elijah and
pronounced the Lordâ€™s judgement on him  &ndash; and it happened, just as it had
been with the prophets.</p>
<p>A story that teaches us first and foremost not to resist the
truth.</p>

<p><reading>(John VIII, 51-59) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VIII, 51  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™ (word).</p>
<p>John VIII, 54  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myselfâ€™.</p>
<p>John VIII, 55  &ndash; â€˜Î¿Î¹Î´Î±â€™  &ndash; â€˜oidaâ€™  &ndash; literally originally â€˜have seenâ€™
(Him, the Father), but also â€˜knowâ€™. The original sense of the word in
the context of the preservation of the word directly reminds us of
Moses, through whom the Lord was pleased to give the Law in the Old
Testament. But Christ is greater than Moses, because he saw only a part
of Godâ€™s glory, while Jesus reveals God Himself, is God, the Son of
God.</p>
<p>John VIII, 56  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î·Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emenâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™ (day). The literal translation
is more accurate: <q>Abraham should see my day, and he saw (meaning in
hope and faith), and rejoiced.</q> The way Abraham saw is different from
the way Jesus <q>has seen</q> the Father (the word is the same, but Jesus
uses the perfect concerning Himself and the aorist concerning Abraham).
Jesus is perfect, and Abraham was on his way to perfection and to
Him.</p>
<p>The Jews did not understand Jesus again. Their prejudice against Him
is also evident. Instead of seeking a different understanding, when they
see how absurd Jesusâ€™ words were in their eyes, and Jesus does great
things, the Jews remain in their biased views.</p>
<p>John VIII, 58  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is used only with
emphasis.</p>
<p>The Lord avoids the wrath of the Jews because <q>His hour has not yet
come.</q></p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XI, 27-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XI, 29  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Meâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ -
â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) <q>am</q>. It is used for emphasis.</p>
<p>Matthew XI, 30  &ndash; <q>My yoke is easy, good, kind, and My burden is
light, easy</q>  &ndash; is a more literal translation.</p>
<p>The fact that the Persons of the Trinity reveal Each Other is well
described here:

<p>About the <q>burden</q> is written at the following link:

<p>The Lord with His commandments gives us (people) gifts, not
restrictions.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
