<p><reading>(Acts x, 21-33) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts x, 26  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. Used only
with emphasis.</p>
<p>Acts x, 31  &ndash; ‘εμνησθησαν’  &ndash; ‘emnesthesan’  &ndash; ‘were remembered’ -
formed from ‘μιμνησκομαι’  &ndash; ‘remember, recall’.</p>
<p>An important lesson for all is Peter’s modesty and openness, as well
as his testimony that people should not be considered <q>unclean</q> or
<q>profane</q> (Acts X, 28). For more information and context, see the link:

<p>It is also worth noting Cornelius’ friendliness with others, his show
of respect and hospitality, and his precision in conveying the essence
of the matter. All of this is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In general, the reading is full of details about the behaviour of
both preachers and listeners.</p>

<p><reading>(John VII, 1-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VII, 2  &ndash; <q>Feast of Tabernacles</q>  &ndash; is celebrated
in October in the Jewish calendar.</p>
<p>John VII, 4  &ndash; ‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘freedom, openness,
especially in speech; confidence, boldness; all-outspokenness;
frankness; publicity’. Literally in the original, it means something
like <q>No one who does something secretly seeks to be free, confident,
open, frank, public.</q> In fact, the opinion of Jesus’ family was that if
a person seeks fame and publicity, he or she should act openly, not
secretly; if he or she wants to be sure of what he or she is doing, he
or she should also act openly. This is a significant thought for those
whose work involves many people, the public, a wide audience of viewers,
listeners, readers, observers, etc. The following verse shows that
conviction in this opinion is a sign of a certain lack of faith in the
person who is engaged in this activity, as well as a desire to <q>find
confirmation</q>.</p>
<p>John VII, 6, 8  &ndash; ‘εμος’  &ndash; ‘emos’  &ndash; ‘Me, My’.</p>
<p>John VII, 7  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John VII, 9  &ndash; ‘εμεινεν’  &ndash; ‘emeinen’  &ndash; past tense of ‘μενω’  &ndash; ‘meno’ -
‘to remain, to stay, to abide’.</p>
<p>In general, a certain implicit intrigue around Jesus is described in
much detail.</p>
<p>I note that Christ does not pursue publicity, often acting in secret.
Secrecy is not a sin in itself. But it also means that the opinion of
Jesus’ relatives in the flesh above is not entirely correct. We can say
that a person’s confidence depends not only on the outward expression,
and not only on the way in which an activity is carried out, but on the
very truth of that activity. Whereas the Jews make a clear distinction
between public and private behaviour, and have certain <q>separate rules</q>
for each, Jesus is more holistic, He does not divide Himself in two -
<q>here I am private, and here I am public, and these are not the same
thing</q>  &ndash; but He is Himself always.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, He knows and acts in such a way as to lead
circumstances in the right direction. Many people will say that this is
a real art, and indeed the Lord Jesus is divinely acting in this
way.</p>
<p>His words about <q>His time</q> and <q>their time</q> are another testimony to
His God-humanity  &ndash; we cannot direct circumstances in the same divine way
as He does unless we are strengthened and guided by the Holy Spirit, and
He, as Lord, can and does do this.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
