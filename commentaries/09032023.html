<p><reading>(Luke VII, 17-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>(Matthew XI, 2-15) The readings from Luke and
Matthew are actually parallel passages and speak of the same events and
words of Jesus.</p>
<p>After the Baptism of Jesus, John testified about Him to others and
had a Revelation from God about Jesus. Therefore, it is believed that he
sent the disciples so that they too would be convinced of Who Jesus
is.</p>
<p>Jesus’ answer to them is closely related to the fact that John, being
a great prophet, nevertheless, did not perform any miracles. And Christ,
after him, performed many great miracles with many meanings  &ndash; for the
salvation and teaching of people, for the glory of God and so on.</p>
<p>The testimony of Jesus confirms the fulfillment of many prophecies
about John in the Old Testament. It was discussed yesterday, the list of
the most vivid and eloquent of them is at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="08032023.html">08032023.html</a></p>
<p>There is an explanation about the reed and the wind at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02vqYFbKkV7uheSz97DhTCXxoDkfxskeSBA4JqG3BhFczS9pEVFZN36rqh7NnQoLUEl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02vqYFbKkV7uheSz97DhTCXxoDkfxskeSBA4JqG3BhFczS9pEVFZN36rqh7NnQoLUEl</a></p>
<p>Other words are also similar to these.</p>

<p><reading>(Isaiah VI, 1-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>Isaiah’s vision, the Lord of hosts, seraphim,
purification of the prophet, God’s judgment.</p>
<p>A very mysterious, mystical place with many mysteries. However, there
are many common opinions.</p>
<p>The description of seraphim is actually the only one in the Old
Testament, they are considered the highest (at least of those known in
the Scriptures) in an angelic way, who are closest to God, ablaze with
God’s love, through them people can also rise to God in it.</p>
<p>In particular, the purification of Isaiah allows him to carry the
ministry of the prophet.</p>
<p>We see his humility in the words about unclean lips.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the pair of seraphim’s wings symbolically (and the
vision is full of symbols) are instructive for us  &ndash; a pair of wings that
cover the face  &ndash; a symbol of love for God, a pair of wings that cover
the body  &ndash; a symbol of self-love, and a pair of wings that fly — a
symbol of active love for others, neighbours, etc.</p>
<p>In the coals from the altar there is an image of the Sacrament of
Communion, which is why these words are mentioned during Communion
itself.</p>
<p>I would like to note that the answer to God’s question in Isaiah
<q>seems to burst out</q> from his mouth. In my opinion, this shows that in
God’s presence, even the secrets of the heart, thoughts, and personality
traits become clear, which is why, for example, Peter on the Feast of
Tabernacles speaks without fully realizing himself, and Isaiah in this
vision.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand the words about the judgment of God. In
particular, about the numerical value.</p>
<p>And it is important to remember that in Isaiah this is a
multi-faceted and multi-meaning concept. Here, in the vision, the glory
of God is most visible, why one can see first of all those actions of
God to stop sin, to destroy evil, which He does and will do.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis V, 1-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>Genealogies of the first people, except for Cain.
Themes of life expectancy, presence of <q>other people</q>.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote about the topic of <q>other people</q>, today I want to
add to it.
<br><a class="link2" href="08032023.html">08032023.html</a></p>
<p>There are words in the Scriptures that may well indicate that all
people are descended from Adam and Eve bodily, but if you look deeper,
this opinion is again not so unconditional.</p>
<p>Let’s look carefully.</p>
<p>Acts XVII, 26-29: <q>And the whole human race He [that is, God] created
from one [here in the male gender, that means, from Adam] to dwell on
the entire surface of the earth, and appointed defined days [times,
eras, epochs] and borders [boundaries] delaying them, so that they seek
God, or they will not feel Him and find Him, even though He is not far
from each of us. Because we live, and move, and exist in Him, just as
some of your poets said: Even we are His kindred! Therefore, being of
God’s kind, we should not think that the Godhead is like gold, or
silver, or stone, a work of art or a human invention.</q> Indeed, if we
understand bodily and literally, then from Adam’s rib God created Eve,
gave them children, protected them from diseases, settled peoples,
giving them certain territories and times with their boundaries.</p>
<p>But <q>from one</q> in Greek, the preposition εκ is used, which means the
source of action or movement (from where as a source? from what
source?). But let’s look carefully: what action, what movement is
meant?</p>
<p>If only what is in verses 26-27, i.e. physical displacement, the
formation of peoples and nations, states, etc., the search for God, then
the traditional understanding remains quite logical.</p>
<p>But if you keep in mind the entire quoted passage, including the
words about <q>the seed of God</q> (that is, that people become children of
God by grace, according to the promises and designs of God, His
providence, while not being the fleshly offspring of God in any sense),
and also mentioned yesterday at the link above considerations, also
mentioned thoughts in the texts at the links:
<br><a class="link2" href="02032023.html">02032023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="01032023.html">01032023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="27022023.html">27022023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="28022023.html">28022023.html</a><br> then the
answer to the question of the existence of <q>other people</q> is not so
obvious.</p>
<p>In such a case, it seems possible that Adam is the bearer of the
image of God, which in turn is mainly not in belonging to the biological
species of man, but in spirituality and a relationship with God. And
then the presence of <q>other people</q>, besides those mentioned, is
possible.</p>
<p>Then Paul’s words would mean that people through Adam and Eve had
received the image of God, had become truly human <q>in the full sense</q>,
but together with Adam and Eve they also had received the damage of
nature.</p>
<p>I am writing in a conditional way, because it looks hypothetical to
me, and I am citing to be consistent in my reasoning.</p>
<p>In my opinion, taking into account <q>hypothetical scenarios</q> also to
some extent allows us to better know God’s truth, which is what the Lord
wants us to do.</p>
<p><q>God wants everyone to be saved and come to know the truth.</q></p>
<p>This once again suggests that we do not know the history of that time
well enough, that there are indeed many questions that are unclear and
the very existence of which <q>must be</q>, as I wrote about earlier as well
(see the link above).</p>
<p>Regarding the length of life, there are also uncertainties and
mysteries. In general, a gradual reduction in duration is visible.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs VI, 3-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>Lessons about industriousness and harmfulness of
laziness on the example of ants and bees.</p>
<p>Social organization is one of the factors that allow people to
achieve better results if they work at it.</p>
<p>A warning against evil, crafty people who plan evil and seek how to
carry it out.</p>

<p><reading>(2 Corinthians IV, 6-15) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading, which is also read regarding
the apostolic work, also applies today to the Forerunner.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
