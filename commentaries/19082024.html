<reading>(1 Corinthians XI, 31 – XII, 6) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XI, 31 &mdash; ‘ἑαυτοὺς διεκρίνομεν’ - ‘eautous diekrinomen’ - ‘distinguished clearly between ourselves; judged ourselves; were attentive to ourselves’. Most likely, the latter is meant here. The apostle is not talking about judging ourselves, but about the need for attentiveness in order not to ‘fall asleep’. If we were sufficiently attentive to ourselves, discerning what is right, we would commit fewer sins. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XI, 32 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τοῦ κυρίου παιδευόμεθα’ - ‘hypo tou kyriou paideuometha’ - ‘through the Lord we are nurtured, instructed’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case, meaning that our spiritual education is through Christ.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XI, 33 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ φαγεῖν’ - ‘eis to phagein’ - ‘for eating’.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XI, 34 &mdash; ‘ἐν οἴκῳ’ - ‘en oiko’ - ‘at home’. ‘εἰς κρίμα’ - ‘eis krima’ - ‘in judgement; for judgement; in condemnation; for condemnation’.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XII, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν πνεύματι θεοῦ’ - ‘en pneumati theou’ - ‘in the Spirit of God; by the Spirit of God’. That is, in the Holy Spirit. ‘ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ’ - ‘en pneumati agio’ - ‘in the Holy Spirit; by the Holy Spirit’. These are synonyms. To say something ‘in the Holy Spirit (by the Holy Spirit)’ means to say what the Holy Spirit, God, wants and gives.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XII, 6 &mdash; ‘πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν’ - ‘panta en pasin’ - ‘all in all’. <br>
All true value comes from God, so we can say that He ‘makes all truly valuable in everything or everyone’.
</p>

<reading>(Matthew XVIII, 1–11) </reading><br>
Matthew XVIII, 1, 4 &mdash; ‘Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ’ - ‘En ekeine te ora’ - ‘at that time; then’. A common expression. ‘ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν’ - ‘en te basileia ton ouranon’ - ‘in the Kingdom of Heaven’. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν’ - ‘en meso auton’ - ‘among them’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 3 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν’ - ‘eis ten basileian ton ouranon’ - ‘into the Kingdom of Heaven’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of movement and the final destination.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 5 &mdash; ‘ὃς ἐὰν δέξηται ἓν παιδίον τοιοῦτο ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου’ - ‘os ean dexetai en paidion toiouto epi to onomati mou’ - ‘if anyone receives one little child in My name’. The ending of the phrase is somewhat nuanced - one can receive a child ‘for Christ’, i.e. to do His will, or ‘as a Christian’ (in this sense, as ‘a person who represents Christ, is called on His behalf’). Both options are contained in these words. In fact, such a person accepts a child like Christ and represents Christ to that child. This mutual Christianity is the meaning of ‘’receiving Christ‘’ here. One might think that when Christ says in the parable of the Last Judgement (Matthew XXV, 31-46) ‘they have done unto Me’, what He wants most is the ‘mutual Christianity’ just described.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἐμέ’ - ‘eis eme’ - ‘in Me’. The preposition ‘eis’ emphasises here the movement to Christ in faith, the motivating power of trust in Him. ‘ἐν τῷ πελάγει τῆς θαλάσσης’ - ‘en to pelagei tes thalasses’ - ‘in the depths of the sea’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 7 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν σκανδάλων’ - ‘apo ton skandalon’ - ‘from temptations’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises that the world was not created to be a place of temptation, that temptation is ‘’alien‘’ in God's design for the world (and therefore will not be in the Kingdom of God). 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 8, 9 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ σοῦ’ - ‘apo sou’ - ‘from myself’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises the throwing away, the denial, the absence of further connection. ‘εἰς τὴν ζωὴν’ - ‘eis ten zoen’ - ‘into life’. ‘εἰς τὸ πῦρ’ - ‘eis to pyr’ - ‘into the fire’. ‘εἰς τὴν γέενναν τοῦ πυρός’ - ‘eis ten geennan tou pyros’ - ‘into the hell of fire’. The preposition ‘eis’ here emphasises movement and the final destination.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XVIII, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν οὐρανοῖς’ - ‘en ouranois’ - ‘in the heavens’.
