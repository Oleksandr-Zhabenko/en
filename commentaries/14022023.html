<p>Today there were three readings, one of which was in honor of the
martyrs, the other two - on two consecutive days - since tomorrow is a
holiday.</p>
<p>(1 John III, 10 - IV, 6) The two connected readings of the Apostle
are united by a broad general theme of the spiritual life of Christians.
A very deep topic, but I will only briefly comment on some points.</p>
<p>(1 John III, 10 - 18) - how does true love fundamentally differ from
untruth, from delusion. In general, many researchers and preachers note
that there is no <q>theory of love</q> in the Bible, but there is a described
experience, first of all of God’s love, but also of love in a broader
sense (I will add that a person can love in different circumstances, so
the Lord, to not to leave different people <q>outside a certain theory of
love</q> just doesn’t give any scheme, any theory, but gives faith).</p>
<p>Here John compares true love with its falsifications. The example of
Cain, who killed his brother out of jealousy, is very eloquent, showing
that true love does no harm, unlike fake love. Before being tempted to
sin, Cain falsified worship (offering a sacrifice without cleansing from
sins and repentance), falsified communion (not listening to God’s
advice), used brother’s trust (to get close to him), finally killed him,
and then did not show true repentance before God. All these are
manifestations that are also characteristic of falsifications of love.
And the Lord warns us against all that.</p>
<p>(1 John III, 19 - 23) This is about the heart compared to God. It is
clearly visible here that John as heart here calls that part of
somebody’s personality that reveals it, one can say characterizes the
personality, that it is most evident when it has freedom, acts
completely freely, casually, perhaps spontaneously. Here this human
general freedom is called <q>heart</q>. That is, in such a context, all free
actions, thoughts and feelings of a person are born <q>in the heart</q>, and
a person is responsible for them. Therefore, the commandment to love God
begins with the <q>heart</q>. What about forced, involuntary actions? Or
inactivity? They are also related to the heart, just as stillness is a
form of movement. Simply in this case, a person acts not only <q>from the
heart</q>, but taking into account the other factors.</p>
<p>Someone (perhaps some psychologists or neurologists, neurobiologists,
etc.) will say that even a spontaneous unforced action has certain
prerequisites, reasons related to connections in the brain that did not
arise completely spontaneously, etc. I have to say that John’s <q>heart</q>
is not just the <q>spontaneity and freedom</q> of a person, but <q>the core of
the personality</q>, the core of the human hypostasis. <q>Hypostasis</q> — the
concrete existence of nature (here, human hypostasis — therefore, human
nature) — in theology is a logical category that indicates the
uniqueness and singularity of what exists. It is basic, not reducible,
and cannot be reduced to other categories, just as basic concepts are
described in geometry, but have no definitions. In the language of
Orthodox theology, in the heart there is a uniting of natural will and
freedom with personal will, personal arbitrariness. This arbitrariness,
for example, can be established and detected by the fact that a person
can really do one of several possible actions, and he / she actually
does one of them, in particular, if by <q>action</q> we understand inaction
or something similar.</p>
<p><q>When our heart does not blame us</q> - therefore, when a person in a
free state not only spontaneously and unforcedly, completely freely
actualizes himself / herself, that is, when there is nothing that would
burden a person <q>from his / her side.</q> In another place, Paul says about
this: <q>Although I do not know anything (bad) about myself, I am not
justified by that, but the Lord is my judge</q> - he is precisely talking
about the heart. It is in this state that the appearance of God’s faith
in a person is possible. See about it in the work <q>On the power of man</q>
at the link (in Ukranian):

<p>(1 John III, 24 - IV, 6) John talks about spirits and the spiritual,
spirituality. <q>… you defeated them…</q> — them, that is, <q>antichrist
spirits.</q> Spirit is associated with motivation and drives for a person.
There are good works on this at the links:

<p>Two daily Gospels were read about the arrest of Jesus in Gethsemane,
the illegal trial in the Sanhedrin and the three-time denial of Peter.
Also very deep meaningful readings, which will also be read during Lent
and Holy Week, here I will dwell only on some details.</p>
<p>Struck the servant of the high priest with a sword - Peter struck
Malchus with a sword, as is evident from other Gospels.</p>
<p>The trial of the Sanhedrin was held at night to speed things up, but
the Law forbids trials at night. Therefore, it was illegal.</p>
<p>Jesus in Mark openly calls Himself <q>Son of Man</q> and <q>Lord</q> from the
prophecy of Daniel and the Psalm (Daniel 7:13-14, also Psalm 110
(109):1). There is nothing wrong with the expected Messiah quoting these
prophecies about Himself, as Jesus Christ did. Moreover, the very form
of the question of the high priest Caiaphas testifies to a certain
belief that the Messiah can be called the Son of God (even from the
point of view of the Jews). In particular, in other synoptics, Jesus
refers to this faith in the answer (it sounds <q>softer</q> in them). Jesus
is thus accused by the Sanhedrin of… their own unbelief, not having any
sin. But it is evident that the unbelief of the Sanhedrin is not the sin
of Jesus, and therefore in no way can any condemnation be based on this
charge. Anger blinded the Jews, and they hastily passed their
unrighteous sentence.</p>
<p>There is an essay about Peter’s renunciation at the link:
