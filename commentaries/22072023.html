<p><reading>(Romans XII:1-3) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans XII, 3  - endash εμερισεν  - endash ‘emerisen’ (from μεριζω)
- ‘distributed, divided into parts’.</p>
<p>This is a theologically rich passage, so the reading is brief and
concise.</p>
<p>Paul teaches about reasonable service (ministtry) to God, which, in
addition to the mind, unites the whole person in his life. In
particular, the body is mentioned directly.</p>
<p>The apostle also calls God’s will <q>good, which brings joyful
satisfaction and is perfect, complete</q>. If a person performs this
reasonable service, then they will know God’s will, God’s grace, God.
<q>Cognises</q> also means unites. This is generally a reference to the
blessed life of believers through Christ.</p>
<p>Paul also teaches humble wisdom, to have a sober and true opinion
about oneself and everything.</p>
<p><q>To the measure of faith</q>  - endash a humble person has a more or less stable
opinion of themselves, knows themselves well, in particular through
self-discovery. But most of all, their perception changes… through the
cognition of faith, through the cognition of the truth of faith, through
the cognition of God and His actions in life. These are the most
important <q>degrees of freedom</q> in the language of physics. Therefore,
the measure of a person’s opinion of themselves is their faith, the
degree of their faith, its depth, its implementation in their own life
and in the lives of others. Similarly, in true love, a person begins to
associate themselves, to connect with this love, and it becomes their
primary measure of themselves.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew X, 37  - endash XI, 1) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew X, 37, 40  - endash ‘εμε’  - endash ‘eme’  - endash ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Part of the reading was read on All Saints’ Sunday:
<br><a class="link2" href="11062023.html">11062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Matthew X, 39  - endash ‘εμου’  - endash ‘emou’  - endash ‘Me’. Here Christ says that whoever
seeks to have (get, find, build, etc.) their life outside the Gospel,
like the prodigal son in the parable, will destroy their life. But if
someone loses something of their own for the sake of doing God’s will,
for the sake of the Gospel, for the sake of Christ, they will keep it
for eternity in the best sense, which will be explained further on.</p>
<p>What a person does for the sake of God, they will never lose. God
will repay a hundredfold for every genuine good done in His name,
according to the Gospel. Even if a person later renounces, the good done
in God will not disappear or be rejected, but God will reward the person
in one way or another. This, as I wrote earlier, does not mean that the
person will necessarily be saved, but it does mean that God will not
forget or despise that actual good. For Matthew, who speaks several
times in the Gospel about ” Heavenly possessions and rewards,
treasures”, this was personally meaningful as he was a former financial
worker (in modern terms).</p>

<p>I would also add that there is a direct flow of God’s grace from the
Father to people: if a person accepts the apostles, prophets, and
believers, this is an acceptance of Jesus and the Father.</p>
<p>GLory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
