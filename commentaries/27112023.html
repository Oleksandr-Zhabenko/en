<reading>(1 Timothy I, 1-7) </reading><br>
1 Timothy I, 1, 2 - '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).<br>
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the 1st Epistle of the Apostle Paul to Timothy, an apostle of 70, one of Paul's closest collaborators and disciple. The epistle is considered to be pastoral, that is, it concerns Timothy's ministry (and therefore not only his) as a Church shepherd, in particular as an example for bishops.<br>
</p>
<p>
The <q>commandments</q> are God's commandments, a brief summary of which is given hereafter. As is well known, purity of heart is not just sincerity (it includes the latter as a component), but purification from sins and sinful passions, the purity mentioned in the 6th commandment of bliss. A good conscience means a constant awareness of good and evil, as well as doing and thinking good rather than evil. And sincere faith means not just a demonstration of faith (in those days faith was widespread as part of social life, so many people could look for the appearance of faith, but not always the actual faith), but true faith, God's faith.<br>
</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul instructed Timothy to put an end to vain arguments and speculation in Ephesus, where there were those who were trying to capture and attract people's attention with vain thought constructs. Paul testifies that those speculations are vain.<br>
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIX, 37-44) </reading><br>
Luke XIX, 42 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥' - 'emera' - 'day' ((on) day).<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 43 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±Œπ' - 'emerai' - 'days'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The glorious Entrance of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. Luke gives a brief account, but focuses more on Jesus' compassion for the city, which later, for rejecting God and salvation, was to be destroyed by the Romans. <br>
</p>
<p>
I wrote briefly about the beginning of the reading earlier, see here:<br>

On <q>hiddenness</q>, see the parallel passage on parables - Matthew XIII, 13, which I wrote about here:<br>

<p>
The Lord did not hide the truth from people, but they did not cognise it.<br>
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
