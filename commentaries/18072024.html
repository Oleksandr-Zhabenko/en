<reading>(Romanians XI, 13-24) </reading><br>
Romans XI, 15 &mdash; ‘ζωὴ ἐκ νεκρῶν’ - ‘zoe ek nekron’ - ‘life from the dead’. The phrase is a parallel to the Easter words of greeting and faith. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates the initial state of death and the transition from it to the opposite state - life. Not that life comes from death, but that people will pass ‘from death to life’.
</p>
<p>
Romans XI, 24 &mdash; ‘σὺ ἐκ τῆς κατὰ φύσιν ἐξεκόπης ἀγριελαίου καὶ παρὰ φύσιν ἐνεκεντρίσθης εἰς καλλιέλαιον’ - ‘sy ek tes kata physin exekopes agrielaiou kai para physin enekentristhes eis kallielaion’ - here a more accurate translation would be ‘you were cut off from the wild olive by nature and grafted into (a) good olive to the proximity with nature’. ‘para’ here is with an accusative, which is appropriate here to translate as ‘to the proximity with’. ‘Nature’ in this verse is connected with life and values, with the character of behaviour, the way of thinking, feeling, and the life of people in general, describing all of this in one word. The meaning of this is that the former Gentiles, now Christians, through Christ, have distanced themselves and left paganism and its life, and have become Christians with their lives. They became closer to Christ than to paganism.

<reading>(Matthew XI, 27-30) </reading><br>
Matthew XI, 29 &mdash; ‘μάθετε ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ' - 'mathete ap emou' - 'learn from Me'. The use of the preposition ‘apo’ in its form ‘ap’ before the vowel of the next word indicates the individual characteristics of the believers in fulfilling this commandment. Christ does not call us all to literally come to bodily crucifixion, for example, but each believer must learn in their own way, in their own place, in their own circumstances, to the best of their ability, according to their own personality, individuality, etc. In this sense, all believers are not fully like Christ, 'set apart' in this age from Him without sin (hence the preposition), but by His foreknowledge, vocation and permission, for the sake of diversity of ministry and common wealth and good.
