Hebrews V, 11 &mdash; 'á¼¡Î¼á¿–Î½' - 'emin' - (to) 'us'.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VI, 1 &mdash; 'Î¸ÎµÎ¼Î­Î»Î¹Î¿Î½' - 'themelion' - 'foundation'.

The conclusion of the reading is also explained there.

<p>
The majority of today's reading (the beginning and middle) is devoted to the topic of distinguishing between the basics and what is accessible to those who are more experienced than those who are beginning the journey of faith. For teachers, this is an understandable distinction, since the whole system of education is built on the principle of gradualism and continuity &mdash; the more complex is built on the basis of the simpler and is studied after it.

For God, there is no <q>difficult</q>, but for people, due to the limited capacity of creation, there is a difference between simple and complex.

Paul's words about babies and adults are not a reproach in their own sense, but an example that is clear and understandable to everyone, but if a person is unwilling to develop or, for various reasons, has not developed spiritually for a certain time, they may sound like a reproach to them, and then the Paul's words are actually an encouragement to grow.
