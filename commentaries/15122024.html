it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Ephesians IV, 1-6) </reading><br>
Ephesians IV, 1 &mdash; ‘ὁ δέσμιος ἐν κυρίῳ ἀξίως περιπατῆσαι τῆς κλήσεως ἧς ἐκλήθητε’ - ‘o desmios en kyrio axios peripatesai tes leseos hes eklethete’ - ‘a prisoner in the Lord, so that you may walk worthy of the calling; a prisoner, that you may walk worthy of the calling in the Lord; a prisoner, that you may walk in the Lord worthy of the calling’’. Generally speaking, this is another case where different translations are possible, where the words ‘in the Lord’ can refer to both Paul's imprisonment and his request to the readers of the letter. Most likely, it is a deliberate play on words that implies the correctness and simultaneity of these meanings.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἀγάπῃ’ - ‘en agape’ - ‘in love; with love’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that love should be in everything in general, and the second that love is of great importance.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ συνδέσμῳ τῆς εἰρήνης’ - ‘en to syndesmo tes eirenes’ - ‘in the bond of peace; with the bond of peace; in the union of peace; with the union of peace’. Different translations are possible, but together they convey the idea of peace as something that binds a person's life in Christ and makes it whole.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν μιᾷ ἐλπίδι τῆς κλήσεως’ - ‘en mia elpidi tes kleseos’ - ‘in the one hope of the calling; into the one hope of the calling; with the one hope of the calling’. Rather, the former, since calling is not so much by or for the sake of hope, which makes it more subjective, but by the Lord through this hope, which is more certain.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν πᾶσιν’ - ‘en pasin’ - ‘in everything; in all’. In terms of meaning, the second translation should be preferred.
