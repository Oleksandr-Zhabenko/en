it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Thessalonians III, 9-13) </reading><br>
1 Thessalonians III, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ ἰδεῖν’ - ‘eis to idein’ - ‘to see, to discern well’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose here.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 12 &mdash; ‘ἀγάπῃ εἰς ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰς πάντας’ - ‘agape eis allelous kai eis pantas’ - ‘love toward one another and toward all’. ‘εἰς ὑμᾶς’ - ‘eis hymas’ - ‘’towards you‘’. Here the preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of love towards someone.
</p>
<p>
1 Thessalonians III, 13 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι’ - ‘eis to sterixai’ - ‘let Him strengthen; in order to strengthen’. Both translations are possible, it is the purpose of the action that is in question. ‘ἐν ἁγιωσύνῃ’ - ‘en agiosyne’ - ‘in holiness; with holiness’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that holiness contributes in every way to innocence, i.e. the absence of sin and transgressions, and the second that holiness itself is the impetus for purification, purity, innocence. ‘ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ’ - ‘en te parousia’ - ‘in the Coming’.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XXI, 12-19) </reading><br>
Luke XXI, 12 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς καὶ φυλακάς’ - ‘eis tas synagogas kai phylakas’ - ‘into the synagogues and prisons'. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 13 &mdash; ‘εἰς μαρτύριον’ - ‘eis martyrion’ - ‘for testimony’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose here.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις’ - ‘en tais kardiais’ - ‘in the hearts’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 16 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ γονέων’ - ‘hypo goneon’ - ‘under the parents; through the parents’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case, and the meaning should be the second translation, i.e. it is a warning that betrayal will occur in the lives of the faithful by other people close to them. In general, we need to understand that if there is a situation that is a challenge that may lead to the question of which side to take, with whom to stay, whom not to leave, and the faithful, being truly faithful, will not betray others, then others may fall and betray them. And such situations will happen, as the Lord warns. Seeing certain objective prerequisites, we cannot think that people will be deliberately hostile to Christians, although this is quite possible and happens, but the situations described in the words of Christ will arise from time to time, in certain places. The truthfulness of these words has been confirmed by the entire history of Christianity up to the present day. ‘ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘ex hymon’ - ‘of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates a choice from among a group of people. Not all will become martyrs, but some will. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 17 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ πάντων’ - ‘hypo panton’ - ‘under all; through all’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case, as above. It is implied that the attitude towards Christianity itself will be negative, and hence towards its bearers, Christians. We need to understand that to be true Christians means to stand out from the crowd in all societies at all times and epochs. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς’ - ‘ek tes kephales’ - ‘from the head’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where the hairs came from.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ὑπομονῇ’ - ‘en te hypomone’ - ‘in endurance; with endurance’. That is, with the ability to endure while remaining faithful, which is steadfastness. Both translations are possible and complement each other.
