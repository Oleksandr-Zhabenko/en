<p><reading>(Philippians III:8-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>Philippians III, 9  &ndash; ‘εμην’  &ndash; ‘emen’  &ndash; ‘mine’
((with) mine).</p>
<p>Philippians III, 10  &ndash; ‘συμμορφιζομενος’  &ndash; ‘symmorphizomenos’ -
‘resembling; having the same form as; having a common appearance,
shape’.</p>
<p>Philippians III, 13  &ndash; ‘εμαυτον’  &ndash; ‘emauton’  &ndash; ‘myself’. ‘εμπροσθεν’ -
‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before; in front of the face’.</p>
<p>Philippians III:15  &ndash; ‘τελειοι’  &ndash; ‘teleioi’  &ndash; ‘perfect, having
attained the goal of existence, fully mature, complete’.</p>
<p>Philippians III, 17  &ndash; ‘συμμιμηται’  &ndash; ‘symmimetai’  &ndash; ‘co-imitators,
joint imitators’. The comparison with the story of the Apostle Peter is
also important here:

<p>Philippians III, 19  &ndash; ‘κοιλια’  &ndash; ‘koilia’  &ndash; ‘belly; womb; every organ
within the belly; a symbolic representation of the inner human
being’.</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterday’s reading, with which it also has
one verse in common (8th). For yesterday’s reading, see the link:

<p>In many ways, it has a similar theme to the readings I wrote about at
the links (from the Epistle to the Romans):

<p>I will not go into detail now, but will only comment briefly.</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of the resurrection from the dead, he is not talking
about the general resurrection at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, but
rather about the renewal of the human being, the change from the <q>old
human being</q> to the <q>new human being</q> who is renewed in the image of
Jesus Christ Himself. This is evident from the fact that it is
impossible to <q>achieve</q> the general resurrection, because it will be the
action of God, not human efforts. It can also be said that <q>attaining
the resurrection</q> here is synonymous with <q>entering the Kingdom of God</q>
in the sense that it is used in many places in the New Testament, as I
have written about many times before. It should also be remembered that
in speaking of this age, the Apostle Paul does not forget or lose sight
of the future eternal Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Next comes the theme of constant spiritual growth, which is
exemplified by the Apostle Paul. He never tires of <q>going back to the
past</q>, of repeating something that happened in the past, but he is
looking to the future, he is trying to achieve better and higher things
every time. This is really the attitude of a competing athlete.</p>
<p>Just as a sprint is a model of determination, so Paul’s words show
his total commitment to growing in Christ. He sees this endless growth
as the goal of human life on earth. At the same time, he does not say
that this is the only goal, speaking of other people. But for Paul, God
revealed it in this way, revealed it to everyone.</p>
<p>To reinforce his point, he gives a contrasting example of those who
live in a completely opposite way.</p>
