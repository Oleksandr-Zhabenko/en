it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

</p>
<p>
1 John III, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν’ - ‘ek tou thanatou eis ten zoen’ - ‘from the death to the life'. The pair of prepositions ‘ek’-‘eis’ indicates movement from and into.  ‘ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ’ - ‘en to thanato’ - ‘in the death’. That is, death works in and around a person.

</p>
<p>
1 John III, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας’ - ‘ek tes aletheias’ - ‘from the truth’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates the source of origin. See the references above and others.

<p>
<reading>(Марка XIV, 10-42) </reading><br>
Mark XIV, 13, 16 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν πόλιν’ - ‘eis ten polin’ - ‘into the city’.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 18 &mdash; ‘εἷς ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘heis ex hymon’ - ‘one of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that it is one of a group of people.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 20 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ τρύβλιον’ - ‘eis to tryblion’ - ‘into the bowl’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 23 &mdash; ‘ἐξ αὐτοῦ’ - ‘ex autou’ - ‘from it’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates where the drink was taken from.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 25 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου’ - ‘ek tou genematos tes ampelou’ - ‘from the fruit of the vine; of the fruit of the vine’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates where the wine comes from. ‘ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘en te basileia tou theou’ - ‘in the Kingdom of God’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 26 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν’ - ‘eis to oros ton elaion’ - ‘to the Mount of Olives’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of movement and the destination where they went to.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 28 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν’ - ‘eis ten Galilaian’ - ‘into Galilee’. That is, the Lord promises to arrive there faster than the disciples.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 32 &mdash; ‘εἰς χωρίον οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Γεθσημανεί’ - ‘eis khorion hou to onoma Gethsemanei’ - ‘to a place which is called Gethsemane’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 35 &mdash; ‘παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>parelthe ap autou</q> - <q>would have passed close to Him; would have passed Him; would have passed Him around</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ and the prefix ‘par’ indicate that it is both a movement near and aside, i.e. ‘coming close, passing by, passing without touching’. Here, the very experience of Jesus in anticipation is not yet called ‘His hour’.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 36 &mdash; ‘παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ' - <q>parenenke to poterion touto ap emou</q> - 'carry this cup past Me; take this cup away from Me'. A similar arrangement to the previous verse. The use of complex shades of meaning with prepositions and prefixes indicates that Christ's human will is searching for some particular way to avoid experiencing what awaits. At the same time, Christ's human will is obedient to God's will. Christ does not seek to avoid what is coming, does not deny that it will happen, but entrusts Himself to the Father (and the Spirit). Only God can change it; the Lord trusts Him completely. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 38 &mdash; ‘ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν’ - ‘hina me elthete eis peirasmon’ - ‘so that one does not enter into temptation'. The parallel to the Lord's Prayer (citation) is all the more touching in relation to what Christ Himself is going through.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 41 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν’ - ‘eis tas kheiras ton amartolon’ - ‘into the hands of sinners’. Christ entrusted Himself into the hands of the Father and the Spirit in full trust through prayer, and now He entrusts Himself into the hands of sinners in full obedience, without being a sinner.
