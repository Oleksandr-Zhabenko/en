<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XV, 39-45) </reading>
</p>
<p>This reading is preceded by the one about
which I wrote the following:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKiw7X6r6YP/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CKiw7X6r6YP/</a><br>
<q>The Holy Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, says in another place:</q>‚Ä¶what
you sow is not made alive unless it dies. And what you sow, you do not
sow that body that shall be, but mere grain‚Äîperhaps wheat or some other
grain. But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own
body.‚Äù (1 Corinthians XV, 36-38). Until the seed sprouts in good soil
according to the vocation it has  &ndash; to be a seed and grow into wheat  &ndash; it
remains alone, lonely. The grain is not bound by its body to other
grains (maybe only by the place of storage) and is not sprouted wheat.
And if someone were to look at it, they would think that it is a lonely,
single grain. But growth is important, according to the vocation, it is
important for the grain to remain wheat, and in good soil it sprouts.
And the body, the relationship, is different from the grain, the sower
does not know what the wheat will look like. But God knows everything,
to Him be glory forever. Amen.‚Äù</p>
<p>The continuation of today‚Äôs reading is the one I wrote about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="25032023.html">25032023.html</a></p>
<p>1 Corinthians XV, 45  &ndash; a parallel to Genesis II, 7, which I wrote
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="10092023.html">10092023.html</a></p>
<p>Here, in verse 45, the apostle Paul builds his thought on the basis
of the meaning of the word <q>Adam</q>  &ndash; <q>earthly</q> (actually a synonym for
<q>human</q>). The first Adam (and the people with him) is soulful, that is,
he receives life from the Holy Spirit, from God, and the Second Adam is
Jesus Christ, who gives life as a God-human and receives life as a human
being. And the <q>Last Adam</q> can be understood as a figurative expression
that indicates God‚Äôs purpose, the direction of development of saved
people  &ndash; they must be filled with the Holy Spirit, God, so that through
them life is given to the rest of creation. That is, Paul means that
through Jesus Christ, and in the Kingdom of God, through deified people,
through glorified saints, life will be given to other creatures, the
saints will be like the Holy Spirit, the Lord Life-Giving in this.</p>
<p>In general, the Apostle Paul means that the human condition will
change. It is not the nature in God‚Äôs intention that will change into a
different nature, for people will remain people, but the state of the
whole creation.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke V, 27-32) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke V, 31  &ndash; ‚ÄòŒ∫Œ±Œ∫œâœÇ ŒµœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ‚Äô  &ndash; ‚Äòkakos ekhontes‚Äô -
‚Äòwho have evil, something really bad‚Äô. This expression in relation to
serious illnesses is used in the Gospel of Mark. Luke, like Mark,
approaches the issue from the perspective of the sick person themselves.
