Glory Be to Jesus Christ!<br>

<p>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XIII, 4 — XIV, 5) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XIII, 9, 10, 12 &mdash; ‘ἐκ μέρους’ - ‘ek merous’ - ‘in part’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIII, 11 &mdash; ‘ἤμην’ - ‘emen’ - ‘was’.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XIII, 12 &mdash; ‘δι’ ἐσόπτρου - ‘di esoptrou’ - ‘through a mirror; with a mirror as a means’. The words are known to be explained by the fact that mirrors were very imperfect at that time and one saw in them in general outlines, approximately, although this possibility was often very valuable. ‘ἐν αἰνίγματι’ - ‘en ainigmati’ - ‘in a riddle; by an enigma’.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew XX, 1-16) </reading><br>
Matthew XX, 1, 2, 4, 7 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα’ - ‘eis ton ampelona’ - ‘into the vineyard’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐκ δηναρίου τὴν ἡμέραν’ - ‘ek denariou ten emeran’ - ‘for a denarius a day; for a denarius per day’. A common expression of this meaning.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ’ - ‘en te agora’ - ‘in the marketplace’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 6 &mdash; ‘ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν’ - ‘olen ten emeran’ - ‘all day long’. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 7 &mdash; ‘ἡμᾶς’ - ‘emas’ - ‘us’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 8 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν ἐσχάτων’ - ‘apo ton eskhaton’ - ‘from the last’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates a transition from the latter to the former. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 12 &mdash; ‘ἡμῖν’ - ‘emin’ - ‘to us’. ‘ἡμέρας’ - ‘emeras’ - ‘day’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XX, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς ἐμοῖς’ - ‘en tois emois’ - ‘in mine; with mine’. The literal translation gives the first option, which shows that the owner is in his vineyard and acts ‘in his property’, we can say ‘in his authority, as expected and as agreed’. 
</p>
<p>
A kind of parable, full of comfort, but also with a certain lesson. I would like to draw attention to the fact that people's feelings, thoughts, and assessments often let them down. Their attitudes change as events and circumstances unfold, as they gain experience, and so on. Instead, God, who is portrayed as a host, addresses the essence of the matter &mdash; a reward of one denarius was agreed upon, and He fulfilled the promise in full.
