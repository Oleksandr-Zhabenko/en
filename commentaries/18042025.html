This is also perichoresis (see verses 10, 11 above), but additionally refers to the Son&amp;amp;#39;s being of one essence with the Father and the Spirit in the Godhead and with human beings in the human nature. All people have commonality with Christ by nature, even those who are enemies of Christ, but only the faithful have perichoresis - hypostatic inter-being with God. See also on the Eucharist here:

It is necessary to understand that God can be everywhere in three different ways: by existence and power (1), by grace (2), and by communion, by sharing (3). Perichoresis is precisely about the third way — communion, sharing, partaking - and the faithful are called to it the most. God can act by grace even on the hearts of sinners, manifest the action of grace wherever He wants, and manifests His existence and power everywhere without exception. God calls the faithful and all to sharing and partaking with Him. And here Christ affirms that the faithful have such a sharing."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
The early one: The Gospels of the Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
<reading>(John XIII, 31 — XVIII, 1) </reading><br>
John XIII, 31, 32 — &#39;ἐν αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en auto&#39; - &#39;in Him; by Him&#39;. 
</p>
<p>
John XIII, 32 — ‘αὐτὸν ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘auton en auto’ - ‘Him in Himself’. 
</p>
<p>
John XIII, 35 — <q>ἐν τούτῳ</q> - <q>en touto</q> - <q>in that; by that</q>. That is, through what they will know. &#39;ἐν ἀλλήλοις&#39; - ‘en allelois’ - ‘in one another; with one another’. See more on the meaning of these words in the beautiful verse:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDr3toZNcd2/">https://www.instagram.com/p/DDr3toZNcd2/</a>
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 1 — &#39;πιστεύετε εἰς τὸν θεόν, καὶ εἰς ἐμὲ πιστεύετε&#39; - &#39;pisteuete eis ton theon, kai eis eme pisteuete&#39; - &#39;believe in God and believe in Me&#39;. See more about faith here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 2 — &#39;ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τοῦ πατρός μου&#39; - &#39;en te oikia tou patros mou&#39; - &#39;in my Father&#39;s house&#39;.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 10, 11 — ‘ἐγὼ ἐν τῷ πατρὶ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ἐν ἐμοί (ἐστιν)’ - ‘ego en to patri kai ho pater en emoi (estin)’ - ‘I (am) in the Father and the Father is in Me’. This refers to the perichoresis of the Hypostases of the Holy Trinity - Their mutual abiding in One Another. <q>ἐν ἐμοὶ</q> - <q>en emoi</q> - <q>in Me</q>. 
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 12 — <q>ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ</q> - <q>ho pisteuon eis eme</q> - <q>whoever believes in Me</q>. See the link above:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 13, 14, XV, 16, XVI, 23-24 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου&#39; - &#39;en to onomati mou&#39; - &#39;in My name; into My name; with My name&#39;. There are different translations that can either complement each other or be separate. The first one indicates that the disciples will ask as Christians, as disciples of Christ, that is, as bearers of His name. The second indicates that they will ask for the glory of Christ Himself. The third is that they will ask for the sake of being faithful disciples of Christ, Christians. &#39;ὁ πατὴρ ἐν τῷ υἱῷ&#39; - ‘ho pater en to hyio’ - ‘the Father in the Son; the Father with (by) the Son’. Both translations are also possible, but the first one has an advantage. The second one makes it look like the Son is less important than the Father, which is not the case - all three Divine Hypostases are equally honourable, equally glorious, equally eternal, coessential.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 16 — <q>εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</q> - <q>eis ton aiona</q> - <q>forever</q>. A common expression. See above.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 17 — ‘παρ’ ὑμῖν μένει καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν ἔσται&#39; - ‘par hymin menei kai en hymin estai’ - <q>is in the vicinity of you and will be in you&#39;. The preposition “para</q> in its form before the following <q>hy</q> is with the dative case and indicates here that the Holy Spirit also cares about the disciples, there is nothing to prevent Him from working, i.e. they are close to Him. The future time is referred to in relation to Pentecost.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 20, XVI, 23 — <q>ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ</q> - <q>en ekeine te hemera</q> - <q>on that day</q>. &#39;ἐγὼ ἐν τῷ πατρί μου καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν ἐμοὶ κἀγὼ ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - ‘ego en to patri mou kai hymeis en emoi kago en hymin’ - ‘I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you’. This is also perichoresis (see verses 10, 11 above), but additionally refers to the Son&#39;s being of one essence with the Father and the Spirit in the Godhead and with human beings in the human nature. All people have commonality with Christ by nature, even those who are enemies of Christ, but only the faithful have perichoresis - hypostatic inter-being with God. See also on the Eucharist here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17042025.html</a><br>
It is necessary to understand that God can be everywhere in three different ways: by existence and power (1), by grace (2), and by communion, by sharing (3). Perichoresis is precisely about the third way — communion, sharing, partaking - and the faithful are called to it the most. God can act by grace even on the hearts of sinners, manifest the action of grace wherever He wants, and manifests His existence and power everywhere without exception. God calls the faithful and all to sharing and partaking with Him. And here Christ affirms that the faithful have such a sharing.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 21 — <q>ἀγαπηθήσεται ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός μου</q> - <q>agapethesetai hypo tou patros mou</q> - <q>will be loved by My Father</q>.  The preposition <q>hypo</q> is here with the genitive case and indicates that it is the passive voice of the participle <q>will be loved</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 23 — <q>μονὴν παρ</q> αὐτῷ ποιησόμεθα&#39; - <q>monen par auto poiesometha</q> - <q>We will make a dwelling in the vicinity of him&#39;. The preposition “para</q> in its form before the next vowel is here with the dative case and indicates that the Trinity will be like <q>Neighbours</q>, close Friends of this person, just as people have such a relationship when they move to live closer to someone they love.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 25 — ‘παρ’ ὑμῖν μένων - ‘par hymin menon’ - <q>having been in the vicinity of you&#39;. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ is here with the dative case and indicates that Christ was close to the disciples, had close friendships.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 26 — “ὃ πέμψει ὁ πατὴρ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου</q> - <q>ho pempsei ho pater en to onomati mou</q> - ‘Whom the Father will send in(to) My name’. That is, to glorify the Son. As in the case of the Son, as Christ says in other verses, this is also the will of the Holy Spirit and the Son.
</p>
<p>
John XIV, 30 — ‘ἐν ἐμοὶ’ - ‘en emoi’ - ‘in Me’. This implies that Christ is pure from sin, sinless.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 2 — <q>ἐν ἐμοὶ</q> - <q>en emoi</q> - <q>in Me</q>. This can mean belonging of the branch. The other meaning is that a person was with Christ and then departed from Him.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 4, 6, 7 — ‘μείνατε ἐν ἐμοί, κἀγὼ ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘meinate en emoi, kago en hymin’ - ‘abide in Me, and I will abide in you’. See above on John XIV, 20. &#39;ἀφ&#39; ἑαυτοῦ - ‘aph heautou’ - ‘from itself; by itself’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following ‘he’ indicates here that the fruit is a gift for others, i.e. it defines relationships with others. &#39;ἐν τῇ ἀμπέλῳ&#39; - <q>en te ampelo</q> - <q>in (the) vine</q>. That is, where. &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - ‘en emoi’ - ‘in Me’. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 5 — ‘ὁ μένων ἐν ἐμοὶ κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘ho menon en emoi kago en auto’ - ‘who abides in Me and I in him’. See above.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 6 — ‘εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν’ - ‘eis to pyr ballousin’ - ‘into the fire they cast’. That is, where to.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 7 — ‘τὰ ῥήματά μου ἐν ὑμῖν μείνῃ’ - ‘ta remata mou en hymin meine’ - ‘(if) My words (works) abide in you’. That is, under the following condition. See also more here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XV, 8 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; - &#39;en touto&#39; - &#39;in this; by this&#39;. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 9 — ‘ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐμῇ’ - ‘en te agape te eme’ - ‘in My love’. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 10 — ‘ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ’ - ‘en te agape’ - ‘in the love’. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 11 — <q>ἐν ὑμῖν</q> - <q>en hymin</q> - <q>in you</q>. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 16 — ‘πάντα ἃ ἤκουσα παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου’ - ‘panta ha ekousa para tou patros mou’ - &#39;all that I have heard from beside My Father&#39;. The preposition ‘para’ is with the genitive case. The same construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit&#39;s proceeding from the Father and in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more here:<br>

<p>
John XVI, 4 — <q>ἐξ ἀρχῆς</q> - <q>ex arkhes</q> - <q>from the beginning</q>. This is a common expression. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here the beginning of the count.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 5 — <q>οὐδεὶς ἐξ ὑμῶν</q> - <q>oudeis ex hymon</q> - <q>none of you</q>. 
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 9 — <q>οὐ πιστεύουσιν εἰς ἐμέ</q> - <q>ou pisteuousin eis eme</q> - <q>do not believe in Me</q>. See here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 13 — &#39;ὁδηγήσει ὑμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ πάσῃ&#39; - &#39;odegesei hymas en te aletheia pase&#39; - &#39;lead (guide) you in all truth; lead (guide) you with all truth&#39;. Both translations are possible and complement each other. We need to remember that the cognition of the truth is always a gift of grace, and moreover, in various cases (in certain senses, in particular in relation to Christ, the Father, and the Holy Spirit, as here in the text) this gift even exceeds the gift of salvation, because a person can be saved even though they may be mistaken. &#39;οὐ γὰρ λαλήσει ἀφ&#39; ἑαυτοῦ&#39; - <q>ou gar lalesei aph heautou</q> - <q>for He will not speak from Himself</q>. The preposition <q>apo</q> in its form before the following <q>he</q> indicates here that the words are to be understood in general as a gift, i.e. as a form of communication (in the same combination, here it means that they are the words of the Trinity).
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 14 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ ἐμοῦ λήμψεται’ - ‘ek tou emou lempsetai’ - ‘from Me He will receive; of Me He will receive; from Me He will take; of Me He will take’. There are different translations here, but they are similar in general. It has a rich meaning: on the one hand, it means that Christ prepared the descent of the Holy Spirit on earth and in heaven, and on the other hand, that the Son and the Spirit, as co-essential to the Father and to Each Other, that All love Each Other, have this in common.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 15 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ ἐμοῦ’ - ‘ek tou emou’ - ‘from Me; of Me’. See just above on verse 14.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 17 — &#39;ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;ek ton matheton autou&#39; - &#39;of His disciples&#39;. That is, some of them.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 20 — ‘ἡ λύπη ὑμῶν εἰς χαρὰν γενήσεται’ - ‘he lype hymon eis kharan genesetai’ - ‘your sorrow will be turned into joy; your sorrow will become joy’. An oxymoron. The words denote a special joy in the victory of Christ.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 21 — <q>εἰς τὸν κόσμον</q> - <q>eis ton kosmon</q> - <q>into the world</q>. That is, where a human being was born. The image is related to prophecy.
</p>
<p>
John XVI, 22 — <q>τὴν χαρὰν ὑμῶν οὐδεὶς αἴρει ἀφ</q> ὑμῶν&#39; - <q>ten kharan hymon oudeis airei aph hymon</q> - <q>no one will take your joy from you</q>. The preposition <q>apo</q> in its form before the following <q>hy</q> indicates here that it will not be possible to take away this joy, to deprive the faithful of this joy, it will always remain, although it may be combined with other feelings.
</p>

John XVII, 1 — <q>εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν</q> - <q>eis ton ouranon</q> - <q>into the heaven; to the heaven</q>. That is, where to.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 5 — ‘παρὰ σεαυτῷ’ - ‘para seauto’ - ‘in the vicinity of Yourself’. &#39;παρὰ σοί&#39; - <q>para soi</q> - <q>in the vicinity of You</q>. The preposition ‘para’ in both cases is with the dative case and indicates here the closeness of the Son of God to the Father as a consequence of Their one essence, unity, love.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 6 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου’ - ‘ek tou kosmou’ - ‘from the world’. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates here where the disciples are from - they are a part of the world, of the creation. 
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 7 — ‘παρὰ σοῦ εἰσίν’ - ‘para sou eisin’ - ‘from beside You am’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case. Such a construction is used in reference to the Holy Spirit&#39;s proceeding from the Father and in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more here:<br>

Here it indicates that the reference is to the human nature of Jesus Christ, to what He received from the Father (including through the Holy Spirit) as a Human Being.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 8 — ‘παρὰ σοῦ ἐξῆλθον’ - ‘para sou exelthon’ - ‘from beside You I have come forth’. Similarly to the verse 7, here it is about the Incarnation and everything that followed, i.e. how the Lord accomplished our salvation. 
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 10 — ‘ἐν αὐτοῖς’ - ‘en autois’ - ‘in them’. 
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 11-13 — <q>ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</q> - <q>en to kosmo</q> - <q>in the world</q>. Christ performs His sacrificial service with complete selflessness, while the disciples remain in the world. &#39;ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου&#39; - <q>en to onomati sou</q> - <q>into Your name</q>. This is the only translation that makes sense here.

</p>
<p>
John XVII, 13 — <q>ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</q> - <q>en heautois</q> - <q>in himself</q>. 
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 14, 16 — <q>ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου</q> - <q>ek tou kosmou</q> - <q>from the world</q>. Here, unlike the verses earlier in this chapter, it is about living according to the rules of this world, which is affected by sin, corruption and death.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 15 — <q>ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου</q> - <q>ek tou kosmou</q> - <q>from the world</q>. Here again, from where. &#39;ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ&#39; - <q>ek tou ponerou</q> - <q>from the evil one</q>. A parallel to the Lord&#39;s Prayer. See more here:<br>

John XVII, 17 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ&#39; - &#39;en te aletheia&#39; - &#39;in the truth; with the truth&#39;. Both translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 18 — <q>εἰς τὸν κόσμον</q> - <q>eis ton kosmon</q> - <q>into the world</q>. That is, where to.

<p>
John XVII, 20 — ‘περὶ τῶν πιστευόντων διὰ τοῦ λόγου αὐτῶν εἰς ἐμέ’ - ‘peri ton pisteuonton dia tou logou auton eis eme’ - ‘concerning those who believe in Me through their word’. See above on John XIV, 1.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 21 — &#39;καθὼς σύ πατὴρ ἐν ἐμοὶ κἀγὼ ἐν σοί&#39; - &#39;kathos sy pater en emoi kago en soi&#39; - &#39;just as you, Father, are in Me, and I also am in You&#39;. See above for the perichoresis on John XIV, 20.
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 23 — <q>ἐγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ σὺ ἐν ἐμοί</q> - <q>ego en autois kai sy en emoi</q> - <q>I am in them and You are in Me</q>. &#39;ἵνα ὦσιν τετελειωμένοι εἰς ἕν&#39; - ‘hina osin teteleiomenoi eis hen’ - <q>that they may be perfected (completed) unto one</q>. That is, that their perfection be unity, not disagreement, discord, and that they really be such. 
</p>
<p>
John XVII, 26 — ‘ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη ἣν ἠγάπησάς με ἐν αὐτοῖς ᾖ κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς’ - ‘hina he agape hen egapesas me en autois e kago en autois’ - ‘that the love which You loved Me may be in them, and I also may be in them’. See above on perichoresis.
</p>

<p>
John XVIII, 36 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου&#39; - &#39;ek tou kosmou toutou&#39; - &#39;from this world&#39;. In other words, the Kingdom of God exists according to different rules, not in the way that sinful people try to build earthly dominion.
</p>
<p>
John XVIII, 37 — ‘εἰς τοῦτο’ - ‘eis touto’ - ‘for this’. The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates the purpose of the action. &#39;εἰς τὸν κόσμον&#39; - <q>eis ton kosmon</q> - <q>into the world</q>.

</p>
<p>
John XIX, 12 — &#39;ἐκ τούτου&#39; - &#39;ek toutou&#39; - &#39;from that; since that&#39;. Perhaps the former, not the latter. That is, Jesus&#39; words prompted Pilate to release Him. Here we see the greatest scope of his hesitation.
