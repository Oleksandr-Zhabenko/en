<p>There were two readings today, one of which was in honor of the holy martyr Ignatius the God-bearer. According to tradition, it was Jesus Who set him as an example as a child (Mark IX, 33-37), which was read today. Wrote a good essay about it recently, see the link:</p>

<p><reading>(2 Timothy III, 1-9) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Apostle was read the place where Paul describes the people of the last times. As I wrote recently about the letters of the Apostle Peter, not all people will be like that, but each of the named sins, passions, mistakes, etc. will have many <q>adherents</q>, people who will be like that and consider it the norm. Here, Paul names the trends where paganism, unbelief, etc. are moving, which, not having any reliable basis, can <q>drift</q> under the influence of people's desires. People who will search for truth, goodness, true beauty will be different. Here, the state of people who have lost hope in real values is described more.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XX, 45  &ndash; XXI, 4) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Gospel, the revelation of hypocrisy was read, as well as the praise of the poor widow and her modest gift of love and poverty. A story that often inspired people to monasticism, in particular to voluntary poverty for the sake of getting closer to God. It is a well-known thought that God looks first of all at our hearts, in particular at the value of offerings and gifts.</p>
<p>Both parts are united by one thought  &ndash; if a person does something related to faith not out of a sincere heart, but due to other reasons, for example, tradition, social structure, level of social development, etc., then he / she does not do it really righteous, but the wrong attitude can also <q>take the holy place</q> of true relationships with God and people, make a person almost incorrigible and tempt others to that.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
