it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

As tomorrow is a big holiday on a weekday, tomorrow's daily readings are postponed to today, so I am presenting both at once.

<p>
<reading>(Colossians III, 17 — IV, 1; IV, 2-9) </reading><br>
Colossians III, 17 &mdash; ‘ἐν λόγῳ’ - ‘en logo’ - ‘in the word; with the word’. ‘ἐν ἔργῳ’ - ‘en ergo’ - ‘in the work; with the work’. Both translations are possible. ‘ἐν ὀνόματι’ - ‘en onomati’ - ‘into the name; in the name; with the name’. All translations are possible, the first indicating the goal of glorifying the name of Christ, the second how to do it in accordance with God's will, and the third what gives strength and inspiration to do so.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 18, 20, IV, 7 &mdash; ‘ἐν κυρίῳ’ - ‘en kyrio’ - ‘in the Lord; to the Lord’. Verse 20 may be interpreted as the second option.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 22 &mdash; ‘ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλίαις’ - ‘en ophthalmodouliais’ - ‘in the service of the eyes; in the visible service; in the service for the human eye; with the service of the eyes; with the demonstrative service’. All of these translations are possible in terms of meaning, but they are all similar. ‘ἐν ἁπλότητι’ - ‘en haploteti’ - ‘in sincerity; in simplicity; with sincerity; with simplicity’. All translations are possible, and together they show the general nature of the ministry.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 23 &mdash; ‘ἐκ ψυχῆς’ - ‘ek psykhes’ - ‘from the soul’. That is, quite sincerely, as if it were not someone else's will, but your own.
</p>
<p>
Colossians III, 24 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ κυρίου’ - ‘apo kyriou’ - ‘from the Lord’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is a gift from God.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν οὐρανῷ’ - ‘en ourano’ - ‘in heaven’. 
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ’ - ‘en aute en eukharistia’ - ‘in it in thanksgiving; in it with thanksgiving; with it in thanksgiving; with it with thanksgiving’. All of these translations are possible, and together they emphasise the union of prayer and thanksgiving in vigilance.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 5 &mdash; ‘Ἐν σοφίᾳ’ - ‘’En sophia‘’ - <q>in wisdom</q>. That is, ‘wisely’.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν χάριτι’ - ‘en khariti’ - ‘in grace; gracious’. In other words, the kind of attitude that shows a goodwill and kindness.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 8 &mdash; ‘εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο’ - ‘eis auto touto’ - ‘for this purpose; for this very purpose’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘ex hymon’ - ‘of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates a choice from a group of people.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke XVIII, 15-17, 26-30; 31-34) </reading><br>
Luke XVIII, 17 &mdash; ‘εἰς αὐτήν’ - ‘eis auten’ - ‘into it'.
</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 27 &mdash; ‘παρὰ ἀνθρώποις’ - ‘para anthropois’ - ‘near the people’. ‘παρὰ τῷ θεῷ’ - ‘para to theo’ - ‘near God’. The preposition ‘para’ is here with the dative case. Here the Lord indicates that it is possible to distinguish between living in accordance with God's will, as in being close to God, and not living in accordance with God's will, as in the case of (many) people. For more on what is often referred to in the Gospels as entering the Kingdom of Heaven/God, see the following links:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/20042023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 30 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ’ - ‘en to kairo touto’ - ‘at this time’. ‘ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι’ - ‘en to aioni’ - ‘in age’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 31 &mdash; ‘εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ’ - ‘eis Ierousalem’ - ‘to Jerusalem’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XVIII, 34 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῶν' - <q>ap auton</q> - <q>from them</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that the words were ‘completely hidden’, completely unintelligible.
