<p><reading>(Ephesians IV, 17-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:20  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¸ÎµÏ„Îµâ€™  &ndash; â€˜ematheteâ€™ -
â€˜learned, ascertained, knownâ€™  &ndash; from â€˜Î¼Î±Î½Î¸Î±Î½Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜manthanoâ€™  &ndash; â€˜to learn,
ascertain, knowâ€™.</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, with which three verses
(17-19) are in common. Read more about that reading here:
<br><a class="link2" href="28092023.html">28092023.html</a></p>
<p>Then Paul speaks again about each Christian man and woman in
particular and about personal godliness, using the pictorial image of
putting on and taking off clothes.</p>
<p>The image is clear, but it needs to be deepened to be properly
understood. We should take as a basis the fact that the Incarnation of
the Son of God is also compared in Scripture to His <q>dressing</q>  &ndash; <q>The
Lord has enthroned himself, he has clothed himself with beauty, the Lord
has clothed himself with strength and has girded himself</q> (Psalm XCIII,
1). Here, beauty and strength are used to describe the human nature of
the Incarnate Son of God, and we can even compare the soul to beauty and
the body to strength.</p>
<p>The renewal with the spirit of the mind is well described at the
following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="10092023.html">10092023.html</a></p>
<p>Taking all this into account, we can see that Paul is referring to
the constant renewal of human life in accordance with the grace of God
and what the Lord has intended for human nature. This does not mean some
kind of acting, a <q>mask</q> in the form of piety that <q>hides the true
essence of human life</q>, but a complete renewal of the whole of human
life in accordance with Godâ€™s will through the gifts of grace in
God.</p>
<p>A human being cannot become holy on their own, on their own strength,
and neither will God transfigure the human being without their active
participation, so cooperation, <q>synergy</q> between God and the human being
is required in all this.</p>
<p>In fact, the call to holiness of all believers is also clearly seen
here. Yes, indeed, we are all called to become and be holy (saint) and
righteous through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The quote about the cornerstone is found in Isaiah XXVIII, 16 and
Psalm CXVIII, 22. I previously wrote about the context of the prophecy
in Isaiah:
