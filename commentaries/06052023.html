<p><reading>(Acts IX, 19-31) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts IX, 23  &ndash; literally <q>the Jews plotted to
eliminate him</q> (can also mean <q>to kill him</q> and both meanings are
appropriate here).</p>
<p>Acts IX, 26  &ndash; <q>they were afraid of him</q>  &ndash; not believing that he had
really become different from what they had heard.</p>
<p>Acts IX, 27, 28  &ndash; <q>spoke boldly and openly, confidently</q>.</p>
<p>Acts IX, 31  &ndash; the Church was growing, <q>walking in the fear of the
Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit</q>. About the fear of the Lord,
see the first link at the top here.</p>
<p>In general, it shows the uneasy path of Saul’s becoming the Apostle
Paul. But everywhere you can see both God’s help and the support of at
least some of the faithful.</p>

<p><reading>(John XV, 17  &ndash; XVI, 2; the daily one and also to the great martyr) </reading>
</p>
<p>
John XV, 18, 20, 23, 24  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John XV, 19  &ndash; ‘would love’  &ndash; ‘would love like friends or intimates on
the basis of emotional affection’.</p>
<p>The next few paragraphs show that a mistake can be made through
imprudence.</p>
<p>John XV, 25  &ndash; ‘εν τω νομω αυτων γεγρΑΜΜΕνος οτι Εμισησαν με δωρεαν’ -
‘en to nomo auton gegrAMMEnos oti Emisesan me dorean’  &ndash; someone might
start to think as follows: <q>The Law was written in Hebrew, and it should
be read from right to left, not from left to right, as the Greek text
is. If you read the word ‘γεγρΑΜΜΕνος’ from right to left, you get
‘σονΕΜΜΑργεγ’; Moreover, if you extend the ‘reversal’ further, the words
‘Εμισησαν με δωρεαν’, written in the Law, which mean ‘Hated me freely,
arbitrarily, without reason, without cause’, can, on the level of
‘meaning’, be perceived as suggesting just the opposite, for example,
‘Loved me for a reason’ (the end of someone’s reasoning).</q></p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think this verse can be understood in this way.
Why?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you start reading Old Testament quotes from right to left, in
almost all cases this will lead to an arbitrary further interpretation
(which the words of this verse show in a negative context), replacing
the text of Scripture with something else or even the opposite. But the
Lord, in saying these words, knowing that such a question would arise,
providentially shows that it is wrong to read it in this way (<q>reverse</q>,
<q>on the contrary</q>).</p></li>
<li><p>the word ‘Εμισησαν’ is formed as a past tense by adding the
prefix ‘ε’ to the root  &ndash; this is an example of a typical way of forming
the past tense of verbs and their forms in ancient Greek. That is, this
prefix is not present in the original form of the word. Instead, it
almost always appears when it comes to the past tense. From the point of
view of meaning, such changes in form are unlikely to be in any way
connected with anything or anyone important (except for the Greek
grammar itself). At the very least, the very way in which additional
semantic connections appear in this verse in these two words is
unjustified, unreasonable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Lord providentially teaches even through a <q>iota</q> of
Scripture.</p>
<p>John XV, 26, 27  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘Me’. Verse 26 is very important
in view of the words about the Holy Spirit, Who <q>comes from the Father</q>,
the <q>Comforter</q> (<q>Paraclete</q>) (the English ‘encourage’ is, in my
opinion, the most appropriate in terms of meaning in this context).</p>

<p>To the Great Martyr George the Overcomer: <br>
<reading> (Acts XI, 1-11. The Gospel readings coincide, so there is no need to read them second time). </reading><br>
The story of the martyrdom of the Apostle James the son of Zebedee, brother
of John the Theologian, and the deliverance of the Apostle Peter from
prison by an angel (also in connection with the Church’s earnest prayer
for him).</p>
<p>The event is described in detail.</p>
<p>I would like to draw attention to the miraculous way in which Peter’s
deliverance takes place (as if automatically in the presence of an
angel), which also glorifies the angelic powers and God, Who acts
through His faithful angels.</p>
<p>The reading is connected to the life and sufferings of the Holy Great
Martyr George, whose memory Day is today, because in his sufferings the
Lord miraculously empowered and healed him.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
