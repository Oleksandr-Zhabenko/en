Jesus Christ is the only Redeemer. He took upon Himself our sins, suffering, death, and abandonment by God in order to save us — the Only sinless One for sinners. As sinless, as God-man, He should not have suffered, but by God&amp;amp;#39;s will and permission (here they coincide) He took upon Himself the suffering that creation has experienced since the sin of human beings. He did not have to die, but the death that entered the world through sin and death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam (Romans V, 12-21), He took upon Himself by the will and permission of God (here they are the same). He, being the God-Man, experienced our abandonment by God because of our sins, and descended into hell with His soul, although He should not have gone there as a sinless human being. He did all this as a sinner, being without sin, he took up our pain and bore our suffering, (Isaiah LIII, 4-5). Paul also testifies to this when he says: Was Paul crucified for you? (1 Corinthians I, 11-13). Even if Paul had given himself up to suffering for people, it would not have had redemptive power, because it would not be God&amp;amp;#39;s will, only God&amp;amp;#39;s permission, for your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish (by the way, the name Paul is translated as little one) (Matthew XVIII, 12-14). But Christ took all things upon Himself voluntarily, He is the only One who is such, He came to seek and to save the lost (by becoming, suffering all that is characteristic of) and to save (by remaining sinless, faithful to God, and rising from the dead) the lost (sinners, creation that suffers without its sins) (Luke XIX, 10).

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans IX, 1-5) </reading><br>
Romans IX, 1 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. In Whom. That is, Paul testifies that he believes that his words are from Christ, from the Holy Spirit, although Christ did not speak directly about this in exactly such words. &#39;ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ&#39; - &#39;en pneumati hagio&#39; - <q>in the Holy Spirit</q>. Similarly to what was just written.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 3 — &#39;ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;apo tou CHristou&#39; - <q>from Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that Paul speaks about complete separation, which actually means eternal perdition (because complete separation from the Saviour makes salvation impossible). The verb in the form used here can mean both prayer about oneself and desire concerning oneself. That is, this is a deeply personal position of the apostle Paul, however not unique in Sacred history. See about this in detail further.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 5 — &#39;ἐξ ὧν ὁ Χριστὸς τὸ κατὰ σάρκα&#39; - &#39;ex hon ho CHristos to kata sarka&#39; - <q>from whom Christ according to the flesh</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;ho&#39; indicates here origin according to the flesh, that is, Christ is a Jew by origin, descendant of Abraham and king David, the Promised Messiah (Greek <q>Christ</q> actually is a translation of <q>Messiah</q> - <q>Mashiach</q>). &#39;ὁ ὢν ἐπὶ πάντων θεὸς εὐλογητὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, ἀμήν&#39; - &#39;ho on epi panton theos eulogetos eis tous aionas, amen&#39; - <q>Who is over all God, Blessed forever. Amen</q>. Christ is actually called the Most High God (strong testimony about the Most Holy Trinity).
</p>
<p>
It is one of the most important places for understanding Scripture in general, faith, God, and also matters for modern history. In particular, it is the misunderstanding, erroneous or incomplete understanding of this reading and the themes it raises that is one of the main prerequisites for the emergence and functioning of the concept of the <q>Russian world</q>.

Romans IX, 5 — Christ is called <q>God over all in the ages</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Paul testifies to his love for the Israelites, from whom he himself comes. He lists God&#39;s promises to them in relation to themselves, but this does not exclude that other nations are to inherit the adoption by God through Christ. The order here indicates that it is the Old Testament promises that are being referred to — up to Christ. But after Christ, these promises were essentially extended to all believers in Christ. Consider, for example, Christ&#39;s words: <q>He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward</q>, spoken to the people of the New Testament (Matthew X, 41). 
</p>
<p>
In this sense, the desire to suffer for others is unfeasible. Paul cannot <q>redeem</q> others from suffering by his suffering (see the next two paragraphs, added 16/07/2023 and the next further two paragraphs, added 17/07/2023). It is Jesus Christ, Who redeem others by His suffering. But Paul&#39;s great love for people, even those who persecuted him personally, is worthy of note. The Scripture mentions such love, for example, in Moses.

Jesus Christ is the only Redeemer. He took upon Himself our sins, suffering, death, and abandonment by God in order to save us — the Only sinless One for sinners. As sinless, as God-man, He should not have suffered, but by God&#39;s will and permission (here they coincide) He took upon Himself the suffering that creation has experienced since the sin of human beings.

<reading>(The following paragraph was also added on 16.07.2023) </reading><br>
This is with regard to the question on the part of God (the actual theological component, God&#39;s housebuilding). But in life, self-sacrifice for the sake of other people is possible, for example, the feat of heroes and saints who give themselves, sacrificing to keep others alive or save others.
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Next two paragraphs added on 17/07/2023) </reading>.<br>
We should also mention the holy apostles and martyrs. Many of them accepted martyrdom as a gift from God. But as mentioned above, their suffering, even if free, has no redemptive power. That is, they are not needed for God. God has mercy on the saints not because of their deeds, but out of His grace through the Redemptive Sacrifice of Christ. Christ is the only Redeemer. It is in this sense that it is not God&#39;s will that anyone but Christ should suffer. But it is God&#39;s will that the faithful remain faithful. It is God&#39;s will that the faithful should be an example to others. God wants the martyrs and apostles to be faithful even in suffering, and He wants their patience and love, hope and faith to be a model for others to follow. That is why God permits them to suffer. Suffering is not needed for God, but the fact that the faithful accept it brings them closer to God, testifying to their faithfulness and their establishment in goodness. 
</p>
<p>
God may even direct the faithful saints to suffer (as, for example, according to Tradition, the Saint Apostle Peter did), not because He wants others to suffer, but because this may be the best way of salvation.

<reading>(Matthew X, 23-31) </reading><br>
The beginning speaks about persecution and the need instead of paying great attention to persecutors, to preach the Gospel to other people. That is, one needs to wisely use time and other resources and go further with preaching.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the promise to come earlier, here one can understand that even before the Second Coming itself there will still be a field for mission, that is, there will be a spiritual harvest for labour.

<p>
I have written much on this topic before, a significant part is collected in my publication in the collection of theses of last year&#39;s Round Table.
</p>
<p>
I shall try to bring clarity to the question. Holy apostle and evangelist Luke, pray to God for us!<br>

<p>
One needs to distinguish between God&#39;s will and God&#39;s permission, what God wants, and what He does not want, but allows for the sake of the freedom of creation. In the Old Testament almost no one did this, and following it, especially when quoting, and in some places of the New Testament they also do not distinguish. But one still needs to.
</p>
<p>
This is most clearly visible regarding the place about the little birds. Its translations are very eloquent. Many Slavonic, including Ukrainian, as can be seen also in the picture, add the word <q>will</q>…<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/3791128591185725/?comment_id=3791837754448142">https://www.facebook.com/groups/mereza/posts/3791128591185725/?comment_id=3791837754448142</a>
</p>
<p>
The word <q>will</q> is not in the original… Instead there is the Father Himself. But as Who? Participant? Judge? The one who kills? Creator? Provider? Almighty? Witness? Co-sufferer? The word <q>will</q> is added, but it narrows all possible meanings to their subgroup, where the Father either kills the little birds intentionally, or wants them to become dead... But this is precisely what God does NOT want. Who agrees?<br>

<reading>(Acts IV, 23-31) </reading><br>
The meaning of the passage is that the faithful Christians, the apostles, seek God&#39;s protection and help at a time when people are fighting them through Christ, persecuting the Church and continuing their persecution of Jesus Christ in His followers. The faithful in prayer emphasise that these are only human schemes of those sinful unrepentant people who are powerless against the Lord, who cannot prevent the realisation of God&#39;s salvation and the spread of faith and the Church.
</p>
<p>
The quote is from Psalm II, 1-2; there is also a parallel with Isaiah LXI, 1-4 ff. Isaiah is quoted in the Gospels at the beginning of Jesus&#39; ministry, when He opened the book of Isaiah and read this prophecy about Himself.
</p>
<p>
After prayer, the faithful receive the gift of the Holy Spirit again, this time for confirmation in preaching and in times of possible trials. In the first appearance, there was a wind and a noise from heaven, and in the second an earthquake. These are parallels to the appearance of the Lord to the prophet Elijah at Horeb, when first a strong wind passed before the face of God, then an earthquake, and then fire, and only then the Lord Himself in a quiet, pleasant voice, who firmly strengthened Elijah to continue his ministry. This parallel means that the faithful, although not Christ themselves, are witnesses and testimony of His glory, sent by Him into the world to preach, which Christ Himself directs through the Holy Spirit.

Acts IV, 25 — &#39;εμελετησαν κενα&#39; - &#39;emeletesan&#39; - is a derivative of &#39;μελεταω&#39;, the original meaning of which is &#39;to care for&#39; - here in this context it literally means &#39;care for nothing, for vain things&#39;, i.e. they spend their energy on something that is useless to them. In the Hebrew original of the quoted psalm there is <q>complain</q>, which can also be translated as <q>think, ponder, meditate over</q>.

Acts IV, 28 — the word &#39;προωρισεν&#39; is used, which is a form of &#39;προοριζω&#39; - &#39;to limit in advance&#39;. No, the Lord did not <q>ordain</q> that they should persecute and kill Jesus (then they would not have sinned, see in particular more at the following links:<br>

), but He limited their power so that they would not destroy the believers with Jesus, and He is limiting them again so that they cannot stop the preaching and destroy the believers. The Lord has limited the evil done against Jesus, and now the believers ask for God&#39;s further protection (God&#39;s limitation of the persecutors&#39; evil).

<reading>(1 Peter I, 1-2, 10-12; II, 6-10) </reading><br>
Verses 1 Peter II, 9-10 are a testimony of the general calling of all the faithful (not only priests) to sanctification, dominion (victory) over sin, implementation of God&#39;s will (and one&#39;s own in agreement with God&#39;s) with the aim of spreading salvation to all, making it manifested, glorified, to unite people into the great family of Christ.
</p>
<p>
<q>they were appointed to which</q> — it looks like the Lord <q>appointed</q> them, i.e. made them unbelievers, but in fact they set themselves up for unbelief. The Lord permitted them their unbelief, knowing that they would not believe, but He did everything so that, if they might believe, they would be saved from all the evil. Christ became a <q>temptation</q> for them because of their disobedience to God, 
</p>
<p>
— being the <q>rock of salvation</q>, but they made Him a <q>rock of temptation</q> for themselves — where faith and trust should have been shown, they showed doubt and rejection.

1) 1 Peter IV, 3-5 — <q>the will of the Gentiles</q> - a different word is used than in relation to the will of God and the above. It is possible to think that it is not a direct and immediate manifestation of their will, but tendencies, inclinations that manifest themselves more or less. Not all pagans lived in sin, Peter is not a cunning accuser, but all pagans without Christ can succumb to all the mentioned temptations and tendencies. This susceptibility is called <q>will</q> here. These sins are like elements that could <q>catch</q> pagans (similarly now). In the worst case, they not only did not understand Christians, but also condemned and slandered them. <q>will give an answer</q> is not a threat, but a reminder that is waiting for everyone - we need to give a good answer at the Court of God in order to enter the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
2) 1 Peter IV, 1-2 — <q>he who has suffered in the body has ceased (stopped) sinning</q> - present suffering through experience can motivate people not to sin - <q>arm yourself with the thought</q> - this reasoning does not bring comfort when a person lives well (in peace) ), but when he / she is in a struggle, as if in a battle, then such an <q>additional thought</q> can help her as a spiritual weapon. It is good to live in peace, but if a person is already struggling, suffering, then it is advisable by Peter for him / her wisely have experience as a means against sin.
</p>
<p>
3) 1 Peter IV,11 — literally <q>as if by the power that God directs, like a conductor or choir leader.</q> Not just one force, but many, <q>many-empowered</q> under the control of God. Comparison, which reveals not only motivation, but also diligence.

1 Peter III, 17 — <q>After all, it is better, if it is God&#39;s will, to suffer as a doer of good things than a doer of evil</q>, literally <q>because it is better, doing good (co-creating with God), if it is God&#39;s will, to suffer than doing evil (creating evil)</q>. <q>God&#39;s will</q> — that is, God permits those sufferings. The apostle does not say to seek suffering, but to create (co-create with God) good. If the Lord allows suffering, then it is better for the suffering person to remain good-doer than to be evil. God&#39;s will may wish us to struggle suffering and overcome it (for example, the Lord heals and teaches us not to neglect the work of doctors and the gifts of healing), at the same time God&#39;s permission (allowance) for suffering in Scripture can also be called &#39;God&#39;s will&#39;, and then God&#39;s actual will, not permission, it is for us to be patient in doing good. Suffering itself is a consequence of sin, in the Kingdom of God it will not exist.

Verse 24 literally translates roughly as <q>I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and fill up (supplement) instead of someone else the lack (poverty) of persecution, the distress of Christ in my body for the sake of His Body, that is, the Church</q>. Here Paul does NOT say that he is supplementing Christ&#39;s Passion (as it appears in the common Ukrainian translation), but he says that he suffers as a <q>supplement</q> to the persecution he suffers for Christ&#39;s sake for the sake of the Church and its building, for the sake of the ministry.

<reading>(Genesis XXVII, 1-41) </reading><br>
It tells how Jacob, because of his mother Rebekah&#39;s participation in this, receives more blessings from his father Isaac, who was almost blind, and Esau — less, and how it allows us to better see the difference between these brothers.
</p>
<p>
We also see the sacrifice of Rebekah, the mother, who is ready to sacrifice herself for the sake of her beloved son, and the importance of blessings (especially from parents) and respect for blessings.
</p>
<p>
But the topic of attitude towards the spiritual is key and important in particular for fasting, on the example of two brothers — sincere Jacob, who truly believes and tries to act according to his conscience, and Esau, who considers the spiritual only as a certain means, an <q>instrument</q> for obtaining good, advantages.
</p>
<p>
It was because of the latter that God took that blessing from him and gave it to Jacob — because Esau himself proved to be unworthy in his soul (let&#39;s look at the fact that earlier he <q>sold the birthright</q> to Jacob, at Esau&#39;s dialogue with his father, as well as at the plan to kill Jacob <q>with compliance with the rules</q> of mourning for a later deceased father, to envy). Jacob did not have such plans, because he was close to God, had a good conscience, and treated his brother with respect. Esau, on the other hand, treated the spiritual as <q>points in the game</q>, which can be <q>received for a successful game, passing the game.</q> He was not really interested in God, and he was only interested in the spiritual because of its external significance for the environment in which he grew up and lived.
</p>
<p>
It must be said that later, Jacob will come to make peace with Esau precisely because of the voice of conscience, and will indeed succeeded in making peace because of God&#39;s grace to both of them.
</p>
<p>
Isaac&#39;s blessing of Esau also in this context resembles a prophecy about the secularization of society — people will try to <q>formalize</q> spirituality in order to <q>get more freedom</q>, although the roots of this attitude do not lie in the lack of spiritual freedom (just the opposite!), but in the very attitude of people , who have distanced themselves from God. It can also be said that God cares even about people who are far from Him.

<reading>(Romans IX, 6-19) </reading><br>
Romans IX, 11 — &#39;προθεσις&#39; - &#39;prothesis&#39; - &#39;laid before (in particular, the bread of the offering in the temple)&#39;. It is often understood that God chose Jacob, and that is why he really became a saint. But the fact is that God knew that Jacob would be a saint, knew how he would use and exercise his freedom, so without restricting human freedom in any way, God foresaw who should be called and established. That is why the promises were given to those people for whom they were important. See:<br>

</p>
<p>
This is a general opinion.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 13 — &#39;εμισησα&#39; - &#39;emisesa&#39; - &#39;hated&#39; - from &#39;μισεω&#39; - &#39;miseo&#39; - &#39;to hate&#39; (i.e. showed less love). Here it is <q>less honoured</q> rather than <q>hated</q>, because God does not hate His creation, but cares for it. Nevertheless, the blessing was given more to Jacob than to the elder Esau.
</p>
<p>
Romans IX, 15 is a difficult passage to translate accurately. It is closest in meaning to: <q>I will show mercy on whom it may be shown, and I will show compassion on whom it may be shown.</q> See also more about this:<br>

<p>
It is about the promises of God. God promises something important to people, not because they want it or strive for it, but because He is Merciful and Loving; God promises not because of people&#39;s deeds, but as a gift, nevertheless, to those who can keep these promises and for whom they will really matter.

</p>
<p>
Paul explains why it is not God who is responsible for the sins of creation, for the unwillingness of creation to be with God, for the resistance to God from creation, but creation itself. He does this in a specific way, so that it may seem that it is God who determines what a person will do in a given situation.
</p>
<p>
But if we look at the examples that Paul gives, at their internal logic, it becomes clear that there is no idea that God determines everything.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at the <q>clay and the potter</q>: the potter has an idea of what he wants to get out of his clay. He moulds it in such a way that he gets the desired result. Similarly, God has a purpose for creation, and this purpose was not influenced by creation itself, because the creation did not exist when God thought about it. But this plan was influenced by God&#39;s desire to include the creation in free, blissful eternal life with Him. Hence, the creation has a purpose — it is determined by God, but God does not <q>force</q> the free creation to fulfil this purpose. Yes, He facilitates it and does what depends on Him (like the potter), but unlike clay, people and angels have freedom and may not become like God.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the story of the Hebrews&#39; exodus from Egypt from slavery to Pharaoh. Paul quotes Exodus IX, 16. If we read the whole passage carefully, God rebukes Pharaoh for his unbelief, saying that He had spared him and his people, who had already deserved punishment, until the time of the exodus from Egypt, to show His glory in it. It was not God who made Pharaoh cruel, but God held back His justice against the cruel Pharaoh until the time of the exodus.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, when Paul quotes from the Old Testament, we need to remember that the people of the Old Testament hardly distinguished between God&#39;s will and God&#39;s permission (as I have written about often before, in particular in relation to the book of Isaiah during Lent). Therefore, the fact that God permitted Pharaoh and the Egyptians to rule over the Jews for a certain period of time does not mean that God wanted it. Nor does it justify the Egyptians.
</p>
<p>
Another way to look at it is that God gave people the ability to perform different and sometimes opposite virtues and perfections, such as procreation, but also the ability to be pure. This generosity of God&#39;s gifts creates the preconditions for human freedom, but it also requires that people skilfully manage the powers and abilities of their nature — with God&#39;s help, people should decide which abilities of nature are more necessary than others and when. A person may need to be firm in many cases, but also need to be soft in many other cases. Both are necessary, but they are mutually exclusive (at least to a certain extent). God&#39;s will and God&#39;s permission to exercise different qualities is for our freedom, but it does not absolve people of responsibility for how they exercise their freedom. And the Old Testament texts simply do not distinguish between the two.

Paul goes on to say that the Israelites began to look to the Law and the works of the Law instead of faith, and there was a shift in their right perception, which is why many of them stumbled about Jesus Christ.

In general, the text (in part) shows the richness of God&#39;s design for all nations.

<reading>(Isaiah X, 12-20) </reading><br>
Isaiah prophesies that the Assyrian king, whose attack on Israel and other countries the Lord allowed because of their sins, will not rise above the nations and even more so above the Lord.
</p>
<p>
<q>Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it?  Or shall the saw exalt itself against him who saws with it?  As if a rod could wield itself against those who lift it up, Or as if a staff could lift up, as if it were not wood!</q> is the key question of the reading. Here again it must be said that the Old Testament people did not distinguish between God&#39;s direct action and God&#39;s permissiveness, when God does not desire something, but permits the freedom of action to be carried out, to stop other evils, to call for change and repentance, for other similar reasons, etc.

<p>
And here it is important that it is about the impossibility of anything significant to happen without either the will of God (and then it is good, really good), or without God&#39;s permission (and then really it is not good, but the Lord allows it due to the reasons mentioned above) .
</p>
<p>
That is, the meaning of the question is that the Assyrian king (here, specifically, but in fact, in general, anyone from creation) cannot do anything exclusively <q>from himself / herself</q>, by his / her own strength solely, unless the Lord permits it or wants it.
</p>
<p>
Someone will say: <q>If the Lord permits this or that, does it mean that He Himself does it?</q> — but no, it&#39;s not like that. More about that at the links above. And also here below.
</p>
<p>
The Lord does only what He wills to do. It is impossible to force Him or <q>include</q>, <q>draw</q> Him into anything, if He Himself did not want it. God is never passive in this sense, He is always active. He can never be a <q>victim</q> of manipulations of the evil type <q>here I will do evil, and God will be guilty</q> — no, but it is impossible to involve Him in such manipulations, where He would be a <q>hostage</q> - a <q>hostage</q> of anything, and not would act completely freely, in His completely holistic freedom. God acts actively and freely, only what He wills, and creation can act like Him freely, if such freedom is foreseen and granted to it by God. At the same time, the creation, not the Creator, is responsible for its actions.

As I wrote earlier, the apostle Paul, following the Old Testament people, sometimes does not distinguish between God&#39;s permission (what God does not want but permits) and God&#39;s will (what God wants). This is an example of such a failure to distinguish: where it means <q>God will permit</q> people to have an antichrist (God does not want him to be like that, but will permit it), Paul writes <q>God will send</q> people an antichrist.
</p>
<p>
See the need for this distinction and the fact that it is made in the Gospel at the following links:<br>

Overall, it is a mysterious place that is often understood in different ways. Most believe that the antichrist here is a real person who will appear before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, this place is one of the most explicit indications of the reality (rather than symbolism or allegory) of the antichrist.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the Gospels do not pay much attention to the topic of his appearance, with only indirect mentions and references to Old Testament prophecies, which makes it difficult to understand. This may be because speculation about the antichrist is often unfounded and ultimately leads to unbelief in many people.
</p>
<p>
There are also different opinions as to what is meant by <q>who or what is holding back</q> the appearance of the antichrist. For example, there is an opinion that it is the Holy Spirit, or another that it is the former Roman (legal) state (we could now say strong international law and state authorities), and there are other opinions.
</p>
<p>
The whole logic of the construction and actions of the antichrist is based on the fact that the devil would like to see him come as soon as possible, and something from God is holding back the fulfilment of this desire.
</p>
<p>
It is also often understood that people&#39;s repentance <q>delays</q> the time of the end of the world, while people&#39;s thoughtlessness and unrepentant sins bring it closer. God knows the exact time and all the circumstances as the Omniscient One, but from the point of view of people, events look exactly like this.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is also important that the antichrist should not be the focus of the faithful, because the faithful belong to God. But it is also wrong to ignore what is known about him, because it is revealed by God to people.

<reading>(Matthew IX, 18-26) </reading><br>
Matthew IX, 21 — &#39;ἐν ἑαυτῇ&#39; - &#39;en heaute&#39; - <q>within herself</q>. That is, it concerns inner speech.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 22 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς ὥρας ἐκείνης&#39; - &#39;apo tes horas ekeines&#39; - <q>from that hour</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here the beginning of time counting (from what moment of time did such change occur?). 
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 23 — &#39;εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἄρχοντος&#39; - &#39;eis ten oikian tou arkhontos&#39; - <q>into the house of the ruler</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 26 — &#39;εἰς ὅλην τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην&#39; - &#39;eis holen ten gen ekeinen&#39; - <q>into all that land; throughout all that land</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the spreading of rumours (it is sometimes used in such context, since it emphasises the <q>movement</q> of information and emotions, thoughts).
</p>
<p>
The resurrection of the daughter of a Jewish ruler (synagogue leader, another Gospel preserved the name Jairus) and the healing of a bleeding woman. Examples of the faith of a Jewish ruler and a woman. Both testified to their faith by their deeds, but they also professed it verbally.
</p>
<p>
The other synoptic Gospels give more details. 
</p>
<p>
I also wrote earlier about some of the details in the other Gospels, and I quote:
</p>
<p>
<q>&#39;The girl is sleeping,&#39; was said so as not to attract too much attention; a miracle should delight, but keep one sane, and not cause &#39;craving for miracles&#39;. </q>Talitha, kum!<q> — these words of Jesus in Aramaic even became the name of a Ukrainian music band. Twelve years old is a kind of pinnacle of childhood, when a girl combines both childhood and adolescent and youthful traits, which is why parental love for her (in this case, Jairus and the family) is especially reverent.</q> 
</p>
<p>
I would add that the woman also suffered from bleeding for twelve years, meaning that these two events are linked in time twice.
