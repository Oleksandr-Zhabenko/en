<p>Strong earthquakes occurred today in Turkey and Syria, let's pray for the victims and these countries. The Apostle Paul says: <q>Weep with those who weep, and rejoice with those who rejoice (good pure joy).</q></p>

<p><reading>(2 Peter I, 20  &ndash; II, 9) </reading>
</p>

<p>The Apostle's reading today was about prophecies and the appearance of false teachers, God's judgment against them. Complicated intensive and complex place, only brief comments.</p>
<p>2 Peter I, 21 <q>for prophecy was never of the will of man, but men spoke from God, inspired by the Holy Spirit</q>  &ndash; literally <q>for prophecy was not brought every time by the will of man, but being led under the Holy Spirit, men spoke from God </q> â€” a place that is difficult to understand, some believe that <q>under the Spirit</q> means that the prophets were <q>as if they were writing instruments</q>, and God Himself wrote (as Muslims understand the Koran). However, the majority of Orthodox (including me) think that people announced and wrote prophecies in cooperation, creatively, but in such a way that the human factor was also important, and at the same time God's will, God's Word were revealed clearly. Earlier, I wrote about Paul's position regarding <q>Christ's fragrance for God</q> â€” that is, the Holy Spirit <q>inspires</q> the faithful in the same way that inhaling aromas causes certain feelings, performs certain (good) effects. Regarding prophecies, there is a good essay at the link:</p>

<p>2 Peter 2:3  &ndash; <q>they will catch</q>  &ndash; <q>they will trade</q>.</p>
<p>In general, about judgment and salvation in the Old Testament, many believe that what happened in the Old Testament bodily, in the New Testament happens with the souls of people. If in the Old Testament sinners perished with their bodies, this represents their destruction with their souls. The comparison with angels also testifies to the reason for God's righteous judgment  &ndash; complete incorrigibility, rootedness in evil, which made conversion impossible, just like the devil, although he can theoretically repent, but it is known that he will not do it. Another thing to remember about the judgement is that a person will not be judged twice for the same thing  &ndash; having been punished corporal, he / she will not be punished a second time for the same thing at the court.</p>
<p>Here the secret of freedom is connected to closely, which I wrote about in the work at the link:</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XIII, 9-13) </reading>
</p>

<p>The Gospel read about the persecution of the faithful. The Lord assures that it is not the faithful who will testify at the court for Christ, but the Holy Spirit Himself through them, so there is no need to prepare in advance. I talked about this before, in 2021  &ndash; I will note that the Russians launched an attack on Ukraine, trying to justify the attack by pretending that they exist (but in fact no evidence of this has been provided until now, so this is completely imaginary, fabricated, cunning assumptions and accusations) <q>secret laboratories in Ukraine for the destruction of Russians and their state</q>. So that the faithful do not become victims of such tricks of the evil one, the Lord commands not to think about protection in advance, so that they do not live in fear, do not get irritated because of weakness.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
