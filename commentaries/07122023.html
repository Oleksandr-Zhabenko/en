Since yesterday was a great holiday, yesterday's ordinary readings were postponed to today, so today we have two ordinary readings combined into one. They are given in brackets in a row.<br>
<reading>(1 Timothy V, 22 &mdash; VI, 11, VI, 17-21) </reading><br>
1 Timothy VI, 3 &mdash; 'ἡμῶν' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI, 17 &mdash; 'ἡμῖν' - 'emin' - 'us'.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy VI:19 &mdash; 'θεμέλιον' - 'themelion' - 'foundation'.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul gives various instructions and advice. In particular, the advice to drink a little wine is in line with the medicine of the time (wine may mean fresh grape juice, as intoxicating wine was considered bad at the time).
</p>
<p>
First, he instructs us to be careful and moderate about Ordination (the Sacrament of the Priesthood), because if a bishop ordains someone knowing that they are sinning and not correcting themselves, rooted in evil, he becomes an accomplice to that person's sins.
</p>
<p>
Then he says that there are obvious and hidden sins, as well as good deeds.
</p>
<p>
Regarding slaves, he tells them to serve faithfully. I wrote about the relevant passages in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians earlier.
</p>
<p>
With regard to Christian masters, it means that while slaves were often afraid of non-Christians, they were not, but they could become negligent. The Apostle Paul warns against this.
</p>
<p>
Then he warns against arrogant false teachers and teaches us to cherish what was handed down from Christ through the apostles.
</p>
<p>
He teaches us to be satisfied with the material goods we have, when they are sufficient for our needs.
</p>
<p>
He warns against attachment and the desire for money to enrich oneself.
</p>
<p>
Again, he reminds us of eternal life and the need to put our hope (centre of life) in God.
</p>
<p>
He concludes with a short greeting and wishes.
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XXI:5-7, 10-11, 20-24, 28-33) </reading><br>
Luke XXI, 6, 22 &mdash; 'ἡμέραι' - 'emerai' - 'days'.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 23 &mdash; 'γαστρὶ' - 'gastri' - 'womb, stomach'. 'ἡμέραις' - 'emerais' - 'days' (days).
</p>
