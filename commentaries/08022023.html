<p><reading>(2 Peter III) </reading>
</p>

<p>Today, the conclusion of the 2nd epistle of the Apostle Peter was read from the daily Apostle. Important details: the Lord established the visible world (<q>the earth</q>) and that He used in judgement. Perhaps future people will place great hope on <q>fire</q> (on energy? on motivation?), and therefore the world will be judged by <q>fire</q> â€” God's, not man's. This suggests that what scoffers justify their unbelief is actually for their repentance  &ndash; the length of time until the Second Coming exists for our salvation  &ndash; 2 Peter III, 9,13-15  &ndash; <q>the long patience of the Lord count as / for salvation</q> â€” that is, this long patience of God is for the salvation of people. These words have a real meaning only when humankind, people will approach the fulfillment of God's commandments and God's will in the course of history, not all (unfortunately), but some, and rather in groups. At the same time, it is clear that there will be no <q>earthly Kingdom of God</q>, an ideal society built by people without suffering and sins. Again, the essay on freedom is important, see the link:</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XIII, 24-31) </reading>
</p>

<p>The daily Gospel was read directly about the very end of the world, the Second Coming of Jesus and the parable of the fig leaves.</p>
<p>I quote: <q>the point is that trees as indicators of the state of the environment are often more </q>attentive and sensitive<q> to the state of the environment (for example, trees growing in the center of a populated city often respond noticeably to air pollution, while people often do not feel it so clearly). Likewise, the events, phenomena, etc. described and named by Christ  &ndash; like those 'indicator' trees  &ndash; are </q>more visible<q> than the approach of the Kingdom of God itself. Also here is an assurance of the faithfulness of the words of Jesus and that they will not lose their sense.</q><br>

<p>)</p>
<p>I also draw attention to: Mark XIII, 27 <q>from the end of the earth to the end of the sky</q>  &ndash; as <q>sky</q> it is quite possible to consider the cosmos. That is, the words can mean that the Coming of Christ will take place after the dispersal of humanity in space and will gather everyone into the Kingdom of God. But the same words can have a more modest meaning <q>from everywhere</q>. An important detail in view of what God will give next, we will read tomorrow. <q>heaven (sky) and earth will pass away</q>  &ndash; in the original it can also mean <q>will lose meaning</q>  &ndash; this has already happened in part, because modern people look at the structure of sky, earth, matter and the entire universe differently than the contemporaries of Jesus.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
