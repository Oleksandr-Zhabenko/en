Christ Is Risen!<br>
ðŸŒž
</p>
<p>
With the Bright Resurrection of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, with the Easter of the Lord!
</p>
<p>
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is the greatest holiday, the Feast of all holidays, not one of the 12 greatest holidays, whereas 3 other of the 12 have a transitional date of celebration that directly depends on the date of Easter. In the Old Testament, Passover (Pesach) was a celebration of the exodus and liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. It was a prototype and had many prototypes of the true Easter, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. 
</p>
<p>
The Law itself, in particular the 10 Commandments, contains a prophecy about Easter and the Son of God:
</p>
<p>
â€˜I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondageâ€™ (Exodus XX, 2). These words, which begin the 10 Commandments, directly tell us Who Jesus Christ is &mdash; the Lord our God, who brought us out of slavery to sin and the power of death.
</p>
<p>
On the occasion of the holiday, I decided to present here the â€˜Word on Easterâ€™ by Saint John Chrysostom, which is read at the Easter Vigil according to Orthodox tradition. In it, the image from the parable of the labourers in the vineyard is used in a very beautiful and eloquent way to engage the audience in the common celebration of the Feast of all Feasts, the Holy Resurrection of Christ.
</p>
<p>
The English translation is available online, for example, here:<br>

</p>
<p>
I will also provide here an expanded translation (using a more complete semantic translation) of the beginning of the Gospel of John, which is read at the Liturgy today, with my reflections added at the end.
</p>
<p>
<q>In Him was life&hellip;</q>
</p>
<p>
In Him was life,<br>
and the life was the Light of men.<br>
And the Light shines in the darkness,<br>
and the darkness did not cover Him, and did not take Him captive,<br>
and couldn't keep Him bound, or constrained, defeated.
</p>
<p>
The true Light was He,<br>
Who illuminates, presents and makes clear,<br>
Reveals every person that comes into the world.
</p>
<p>
He was in the world<br>
and the world was made through Him,<br>
arose, came to life, became and came out,<br>
but the world did not recognize Him.
</p>
<p>
He came to people who are His own,<br>
but His own did not adopt Him, did not take Him close to their hearts with love.
</p>
<p>
And for those who did accept Him,<br>
He gave them such ability, meaning and power<br>
â€” to become and be children of God.
</p>
<p>
To those who believe in His Name,<br>
He gave to go forward,<br>
and walk in His name,<br>
and to have praise, that real dignity<br>
â€” all these ones in Him.
</p>
<p>
They are no longer different people &mdash; good or bad,<br>
but they receive their life, their actions, states and feelings from God.<br>
This is their life forever â€” not rejected by them, their own,<br>
for they are born of God.
</p>
<p>
Here is just one more thought<br>
â€” life has different dimensions for people<br>
â€” biological, spiritual, social<br>
â€” fills them mainly from the inside,<br>
but also from the outside â€” it is of high necessity for a person to correspond to life,<br>
so that to be indeed alive.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of that life<br>
is a combination of external and internal.<br>
And visible light reaches the eyes, touches the body.
</p>
<p>
The true Light, the Word<br>
- He heals the whole human with His life.<br>
The whole heart, the soul, the mind, all the powers and the body He fills.<br>
And there are no obstacles in Him.<br>
He is the Same â€” yesterday, today and forever!

There are also many other holidays and memorable events today, but I won't write about them because of Easter. I will only say that today is Liberation Day in the Netherlands, a national holiday dedicated to the liberation of the Netherlands from the Nazi invaders during World War II in 1945.
</p>
<p>
Given the affinity of the event, here is my poem dedicated to those celebrating, in particular the Unity girlband.
</p>
<p>
For those celebrating Liberation Day
</p>
<p>
Freedom manifests itself in liberation, <br>
for example, from evil, from violence.<br>
Sincere people connect this freedom with meaning,<br>
by contributing talents into it.
</p>
<p>
Those who struggle for freedom,<br>
are not only struggling for liberation,<br>
but for everything freedom is for.<br>
For freedom, which is without definitiveness,<br>
is like the sky, vast and wide,<br>
but without the sun and moon, and without stars,<br>
from which you can see neither the earth<br>
nor people, nor future.<br>
It looks like it has vision, but does not perceive.<br>
Like there is space, but no movement.
</p>
<p>
And genuine human freedom<br>
takes the form through the other,<br>
as well as its measure, fulfilment and validation.<br>
In such love, a human being becomes your freedom.<br>
No, they are neither a bearer, nor serve,<br>
nor are a finite destination.<br>
Nor need you to fear its impermanence.<br>
Let it be truly of value.

Ukraine is also now struggling for liberation, freedom and just peace.
