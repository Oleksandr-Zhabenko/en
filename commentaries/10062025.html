it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans I, 1-7, 13-17) </reading><br>
The reading of the Epistles of the holy apostles begins, which will continue until the next Great Lent. The beginning of the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 1 — &#39;ἀφωρισμένος εἰς εὐαγγέλιον θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;aphorismenos eis euangelion theou&#39; - <q>separated for the Gospel (preaching) of God</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose. It means specially chosen, completely dedicated for the Gospel and preaching.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 2 — &#39;ἐν γραφαῖς ἁγίαις&#39; - &#39;en graphais hagiais&#39; - <q>in the holy Scriptures</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 3 — &#39;ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυεὶδ κατὰ σάρκα&#39; - &#39;ek spermatos Daueid kata sarka&#39; - <q>from the seed of David by the flesh; from the seed of David according to flesh</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first points to the Incarnation of the Son of God as a Descendant of King David (according to God&#39;s promise), and the second — that He took on flesh completely, with our human infirmities, except sin.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 4 — &#39;ἐν δυνάμει&#39; - &#39;en dynamei&#39; - <q>in power; by power</q>. Both translation options are possible, the first indicates that God&#39;s power, particularly miracles accompanied Jesus&#39;s activity, and the second — that God&#39;s power manifested to a significant degree Christ&#39;s divinity. &#39;κατὰ πνεῦμα ἁγιωσύνης ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν&#39; - &#39;kata pneuma hagiosynes ex anastaseos nekron&#39; - <q>according to the Spirit of holiness, of the resurrection of the dead; by the Spirit of holiness from the resurrection of the dead</q>. Different translation options are possible, but the resurrection of the dead points to Christ&#39;s action not concerning Himself directly, but concerning the dead. That is, it is not about Christ&#39;s own Resurrection, but about how this Resurrection affected people, about its salvific significance. Christ&#39;s Resurrection is also important for people considering that in a similar way Christ will rise the dead on the last day, and this resurrection will also clothe people in incorruption, which is connected here with the Spirit of sacredness (the Holy Spirit).
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 5 — &#39;εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως&#39; - &#39;eis hypakoen pisteos&#39; - <q>for the obedience of faith; into the obedience of faith</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; has here two meanings simultaneously — to make people doers of God&#39;s will through faith, and also to bring people to the state of doing God&#39;s will according to faith, with faith, by faith, through faith. &#39;ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν&#39; - &#39;en pasin tois ethnesin&#39; - <q>in all nations; among all nations</q>. Where, among whom.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 6 — &#39;ἐν οἷς&#39; - &#39;en hois&#39; - <q>in which; among which</q>. Where, among whom. The faithful are named as being <q>in nations, among nations</q>.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 7, 15 — &#39;ἐν Ῥώμῃ&#39; - &#39;en Rome&#39; - <q>in Rome</q>. Where. &#39;εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39;.&#39; - &#39;eirene apo theou patros emon kai kyriou iesou christou&#39; - <q>peace from (peace as God&#39;s gift, manifestation of God&#39;s righteousness and love, at the same time connected with the life and faith of the faithful themselves) God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ</q>. The use of the preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates God&#39;s gift to people. See more about this at the links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Romans I, 13 — &#39;καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν καθὼς καὶ ἐν τοῖς λοιποῖς ἔθνεσιν&#39; - &#39;kai en hymin kathos kai en tois loipois ethnesin&#39; - <q>and in you, just as also in the rest of the nations</q>. Where, among whom.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 16 — &#39;εἰς σωτηρίαν&#39; - &#39;eis soterian&#39; - <q>unto salvation; for salvation</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 17 — &#39;ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν, καθὼς γέγραπται, ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται&#39; - &#39;ek pisteos eis pistin, kathos gegraptai, ho de dikaios ek pisteos zesetai&#39; - <q>from faith unto faith, as it is written: &#39;But the righteous (from) of faith shall live&#39;</q>. According to what is written above, particularly at the links, Paul writes about the <q>origin</q> of the life of the righteous — it is a continuation and manifestation of their faith. He does not say that faith here is the source of life in itself as such (which one might think from some unclear translations), but means that the life of the righteous is an organic continuation and logical consequence of their faith, at the same time being a movement towards the future realisation of faith as the expected Kingdom of God. Faith in these words is the starting point of life, and in the previous ones — also the point of destination of movement, but already accomplished, that is, to a certain extent achieved and realised. A person who has fulfilled God&#39;s will, the commandments, is righteous, at the same time their state can quite be called <q>new faith</q>, into which they have <q>arrived</q> through fulfilment and life. Also here two meanings are visible — the righteous <q>will live from faith</q>, but also <q>the righteous from faith</q> will live. That is, it concerns both righteousness, and immediately also righteousness from faith, of faith, which is an organic continuation, realisation and development of faith.

Matthew V, 13 — &#39;ἐν τίνι ἁλισθήσεται;&#39; - &#39;en tini alisthesetai?&#39; - <q>with what shall it be salted?</q>. That is, what else can give it the property of that which it should itself be the source of. <q>If the source of saltiness and something most salty becomes unsalty, then what can make it salty again from outside?</q>. &#39;εἰς οὐδὲν ἰσχύει&#39; - &#39;eis ouden iskhyei&#39; - <q>it is good for nothing; it is fit for nothing; it is capable of nothing</q>. That is, it does not have that saltiness, <q>power</q> of saltiness, but also does not have other powers. &#39;καταπατεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων&#39; - &#39;katapateisthai hypo ton anthropon&#39; - <q>to be trampled down by people</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case indicates here the passive state <q>to be trampled down</q>. In salt there is value, task, purpose, which make it needed and desired by people, similarly also regarding Christ&#39;s disciples. But if the disciples lose their state of discipleship to Christ, then the valuable thing that is in them that is needed for others, they lose, and therefore, in such a case their significance will become less than in those around them.
