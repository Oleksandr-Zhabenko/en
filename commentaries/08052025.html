it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts VIII, 26-39) </reading><br>
Acts VIII, 26 — ‘ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς Γάζαν’ - ‘apo Hierousalem eis Gazan’ - ‘from Jerusalem to Gaza’. From where and to where. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Philip had to leave Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 27 — ‘εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ’ - ‘eis Hierousalem’ - ‘to Jerusalem’. Where to. In fact, in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Philip.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 33 — ‘ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει’ - ‘en te tapeinosei’ - ‘in humiliation; in lowly conditions’. This refers to the voluntary self-lowering of the Son of God, His kenosis. ‘ὅτι αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ’ - ‘hoti airetai apo tes ges he zoe autou’ - ‘for His life is (now) lifted up from the earth’. The point is that Christ&#39;s life, although He gives it, does not disappear, but is accepted as a Sacrifice - according to the teaching of the Council of Constantinople - by the Son Himself, together with the Father and the Spirit. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that it is a complete abandonment of earthly life, i.e., suffering to death in general. This is a very eloquent prophecy of Isaiah.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 35 — ‘ἀπὸ τῆς γραφῆς ταύτης’ - ‘apo tes graphes tautes’ - ‘(beginning) from this Scripture’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the count of the passages of Scripture that Philip explained and preached.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 38 — ‘εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ’ - ‘eis to hydor’ - ‘into the water’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 39 — ‘ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος’ - ‘ek tou hydatos’ - ‘out of the water’. From where.

<p>
<reading>(John VI, 40-44) </reading><br>
John VI, 40, 44 — ‘πιστεύων εἰς αὐτὸν’ - ‘pisteuon eis auton’ - ‘whoever believes in Him’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here that true faith leads to Christ, Who is the goal and destination point of the faith, i.e., it is about divinisation. ‘ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ’ - ‘en te eskhate hemera’ - ‘on the last day; in the last day’. When.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 41 — ‘ὁ ἄρτος ὁ καταβὰς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ’ - ‘ho artos ho katabas ek tou ouranou’ - ‘the bread that came down from the heaven’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where the Son of God came from in the Incarnation.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 42 — ‘ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταβέβηκα’ - ‘hoti ek tou ouranou katabebeka’ - ‘Who came down from the heaven’. See above.

To the Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian:<br>
<reading>(1 John I, 1 — 7; John XIX, 25 - 27; XXI, 24 - 25) </reading><br>
1 John I, 1 — ‘Ὃ ἦν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς&#39; - <q>ho en ap arkhes</q> - <q>what was from the beginning</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the counting, i.e. it has been all along from the beginning. The neuter gender indicates that this is not a reference to the Word of life, but to events, or rather to the whole history of the world and people. The coming of Christ revealed the true meaning of all events and things.
</p>
<p>
1 John I, 5 — ‘ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ&#39; - <q>ap autou</q> - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that what is heard from Christ is a gift. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in Him’. That is, in God. Read more about God&#39;s light and the absence of darkness in Him here:<br>

</p>
<p>
1 John I, 6 — ‘ἐν τῷ σκότει’ - ‘en to skotei’ - ‘in the darkness’. The darkness in these words appears as a ‘medium’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John I, 7 — ‘ἐν τῷ φωτὶ’ - ‘en to photi’ - ‘in the light’. Similarly to the previous one, light appears as a ‘medium’. ‘καθαρίζει ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας’ - ‘katharizei hemas apo pases hamartias’ - ‘cleanses us from all sin’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that we are talking about complete cleansing, deliverance.
