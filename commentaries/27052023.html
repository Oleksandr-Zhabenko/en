<p><reading>(Acts XX, 7-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts XX:9  - endash in the original <q>young man</q> (could be
even up to about 40 years old).</p>
<p>Acts XX, 12  - endash refers to <q>boy</q> or <q>servant</q>. ‘παρεκληθησαν’ -
‘pareklethesan’  - endash ‘were comforted’.</p>
<p>The story of the miraculous recovery/resurrection of Eutychus.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the first day of the week is Sunday, when the
faithful gathered for the Eucharist (the Sunday Eucharist is an
apostolic tradition).</p>
<p>The miracle is <q>postponed</q> in time, because Eutychus was resurrected
or at least recovered from a serious fall after Paul’s departure, but
according to his words and faith. If we ask the question whether he was
really dead and this was a resurrection, it is not entirely clear. I
think that since Paul said that <q>the soul of Eutychus is in him</q>, he was
not really dead, but that was the way people perceived it at first,
because he did not show any real signs of life.</p>
<p>In any case, the miracle shows that the Lord can also perform
miracles in worship (Paul’s long sermon was part of the worship service,
the Liturgy).</p>

<p><reading>(John XIV, 10-21) </reading>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>John XIV, 10, 11, 20  - endash ‘εμοι’  - endash ‘emoi’  - endash (in) ‘Me’. ‘εμαυτου’ -
‘emautou’  - endash (from) ‘Himself’.</p>
<p>John XIV, 12  - endash ‘εμε’  - endash ‘eme’  - endash (in) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John XIV, 15  - endash ‘εμας’  - endash ‘emas’  - endash ‘My’.</p>
<p>John XIV, 21  - endash ‘εμφανισο’  - endash ‘emphaniso’  - endash ‘to make visible, to show,
to manifest’. ‘εμαυτον’  - endash ‘emauton’  - endash <q>Me (Himself).</p>
<p>At the Last Supper, the Lord Jesus Christ speaks of His passing to
the Father, as well as of the Holy Spirit, Whom He will send to His
disciples, and of the eternal life of the faithful. The Holy Spirit is
called the Comforter and the Spirit of Truth, and these are the most
commonly used names for Him, besides the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of
the Lord, the Spirit of Christ. The <q>Comforter</q>  - endash <q>Paraclete</q>  - endash is not
only a Comforter, but also an Intercessor, Advocate, and therefore also
a Defender.</p>
<p>If one really comes to know how much good God gives to people, then
one can willingly love God, and this means keeping His commandments.</p>
<p>There are several important points about prayer. Jesus promises that
we can pray in His name, that such prayer is pleasing to God, and that
we can pray to Him. This is not explicitly mentioned here, but it is
implied that if the prayer is made in the Holy Spirit, the Lord will
hear and fulfil it, because He has already prompted it by the Holy
Spirit. Therefore, it is important to pray for the Holy Spirit also with
what we ask for.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Truth and the Comforter also gives faith with Himself,
and there is a good article about God’s faith, faith from the Holy
Spirit, at this link:
