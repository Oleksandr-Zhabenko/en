<p><reading>(2 Corinthians V, 15-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians V, 16  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emeisâ€™ -
â€˜weâ€™.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians V, 18, 19  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™. â€˜Î·Î¼Î¹Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜eminâ€™ -
â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians V, 20, 21  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™. Verse 20 is best
translated <q>for the reason of Christ, for Christâ€™s sake, for Christ</q>
<q>become reconciled to God</q>.</p>
<p>Continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, which also repeats verse 15 for
the second time.
<br>
<a class="link2" href="21082023.html">21082023.html</a></p>
<p>The Sacrifice of Christ cannot leave people aside because of its
significance  &ndash; Paul asks to be reconciled to God through it (the other
option is to reject it, remaining in our sins and multiplying them,
which obviously does not lead to God and eternal life in love).</p>
<p>There is a good piece on Christâ€™s Sacrifice, the Sacrifice of truth
and reconciliation, at this link (it refers directly to todayâ€™s reading,
but in different words):
<br>
<a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>
<p><q>As if God were asking through us</q>  &ndash; God does not ask people in the
proper sense, but invites them (hence the comparison, not a direct
statement), but the apostles, not being God, amplify Godâ€™s invitation to
the point of pleading. God invites, the apostles implore; it is a kind
of synergy, a cooperation of people with God for the salvation of the
many.</p>
<p>This is a complex theological thought, but it is worthy of attention.
People ask for something when it is something deeply personal, affecting
them directly. For example, when Christ was crucified and despised, He
asked the Father for the forgiveness of people because He was hanging
Crucified on the cross, suffering. Apostles and preachers ask because it
also concerns them directly, personally, it is their mission, their
work, their life. But God does not ask because He does not need our
consent. He Himself gives all good things to everyone, without needing
anything from anyone, but He wants us to live in love and joy with Him
in eternity. As many theologians say: <q>We are not needed to God (He is
Self-sufficient), we are desirable to Him (He loves us).</q></p>
<p>And another reason is that it is not appropriate for God to be asking
peopleâ€¦ to be happy forever. But this is exactly what He created them
for. If people donâ€™t want eternal life in joy, what will asking them to
want it do? That is an important point here  &ndash; Paul first of all speaks
of the desire for reconciliation on the part of people, it is needed
that people will want it.</p>
<p>Why do the apostles implore reconciliation? In order not to hinder
the preaching of Christ, they humble themselves in this way.</p>
<p><q>God has reconciled the world to Himself</q>  &ndash; God has done everything
(and continues to do so) to make sure that people are truly in peace
with Him. And God expects people to respond.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark I, 16-22) </reading>
</p>
<p>I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew
(Matthew IV, 18-23) here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="18062023.html">18062023.html</a></p>
<p>Here Mark speaks of something that was particularly surprising to
people at the beginning (and throughout) of Jesusâ€™ preaching: He taught
as the Sovereign of God (which is what the Messiah, Christ, is). But we
must understand that Christ did not have to do it any other way. He is
indeed the Lawgiver and God, so He teaches as the Sovereign, with
absolute confidence and full authority.</p>
<p>This also teaches us that when a person does Godâ€™s work, they should
do it in faith. There is also a good article about faith at the
following link:
