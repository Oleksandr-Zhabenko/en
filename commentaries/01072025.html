it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans X, 11-XI, 2) </reading>
</p>
<p>
Romans X, 12 – &#39;πλουτῶν εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους αὐτόν&#39; – &#39;plouton eis pantas tous epikaloumenous auton&#39; – <q>rich for all who call Him</q>. Points to the gradual revealing, revelation, manifestation of God&#39;s generosity for people. That is, <q>rich</q> in the sense of both generosity (God gives extraordinarily much and generously), and the duration of giving (God bestows eternally).
</p>
<p>
Romans X, 14 – &#39;εἰς ὃν οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν&#39; – &#39;eis hon ouk episteusan&#39; – <q>in Whom they have not believed</q>. The preposition eis here indicates that faith leads to God; He is the final Goal of faith. An important thought here is that a person cannot truly turn to God unless they believe in Him as a Personal Living God. That is, such calling, addressing (that is, prayer) becomes possible as a result of faith in a Personal God.
</p>
<p>
In verse 15 there are no prepositions I comment on, but there is a good non-obvious thought about the feet. Truly, preachers describe their calling to preach the Gospel as one of the most beautiful events of their life — for the Lord shows them trust, gives them a mission for others, reveals part of the meaning of their life and story, and the listeners of the Gospel see in this preaching the true good. The Apostle speaks of the fact that the logic of the spiritual calling to the Good News of Christ is precise, harmonious, beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Romans X, 17 – &#39;ἡ πίστις ἐξ ἀκοῆς&#39; – &#39;he pistis ex akoes&#39; – <q>faith from hearing; faith from the ability to hear</q>. The preacher of good gives the impulse of faith, the push of faith, the movement of faith, and not the person themselves creates this movement of faith. But it depends on the listeners whether they will <q>extinguish</q> the light of faith, or receive, multiply, and pass it on.
</p>
<p>
Romans X, 18 – &#39;εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν&#39; – &#39;eis pasan ten gen&#39; – <q>into all the earth</q>.<br>
&#39;εἰς τὰ πέρατα τῆς οἰκουμένης&#39; – &#39;eis ta perata tes oikoumenes&#39; – <q>to the ends of the inhabited world</q> (the known, then-inhabited world). The words are relevant also in our time.
</p>
<p>
Romans XI, 1 – &#39;ἐκ σπέρματος Ἀβραάμ&#39; – &#39;ek spermatos Abraam&#39; – <q>from the seed of Abraham</q>. The preposition ek here points to physical descent.
</p>
<p>
Romans XI, 2 – &#39;ἐν Ἠλείᾳ&#39; – &#39;en Heleia&#39; – <q>in Elijah</q>. That is, here — in the story about the prophet Elijah.
</p>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16072024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/16072024.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Matthew XI, 16–20<br>
Matthew XI, 16 – &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς&#39; – &#39;en tais agorais&#39; – <q>in the markets; at the markets</q>. That is, in gathering places for handling affairs and trade.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XI, 19 – &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων&#39; – &#39;apo ton ergon&#39; – <q>from the works</q>. The preposition apo here points to something objective that can to a significant degree be considered separately — that is, it is easier to assess the works, the fruits (though not always easy), than the person themselves (which is fully possible only to God). Christ here calls to look at the fruits of His mission and also of John.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XI, 20 – &#39;ἐν αἷς&#39; – &#39;en hais&#39; – <q>in which</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
The words about wisdom are relevant even now, especially for those who want to justify their lack of conversion, their impenitence — their own or others’ — through their individual tendencies and traits, psychology. Jesus and John were in everyday life quite different, opposite, yet united in their call to conversion, repentance. Whoever had an open mind and heart, converted through at least One of them. And others cannot justify themselves by their individual qualities, for some were touched by the example of John, others — of Jesus, and many — of Both. So it is also now, in our times: faithful people are those with entirely different qualities.
</p>
<p>
This place clearly speaks of diversity in the Church.
</p>
<p>
A person does not need to <q>step over</q> their true self (as they are called to be according to God&#39;s will), the one designed by God, to fulfil God’s will. Another matter is sins — it is they that harm everyone, and they must be fought against.
</p>
<p>
It is also worth noting what is often unnoticed. Along with great freedom, people may also see many of their own sins. To the complaint that <q>I don’t want to see so much bad in myself</q>, one can say: <q>But every archer wants to hit the bullseye — not a 9, not an 8, not 7, 6, 5, and certainly not miss entirely… But the archer does not complain that the target is small — rather, they rejoice more when they manage to hit it</q>.

1 Corinthians XII, 28 – &#39;ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ&#39; – &#39;en te ekklesia&#39; – <q>in the Church</q>. Where.
