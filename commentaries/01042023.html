<p><reading>(Hebrews IX, 24-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>Hebrews IX, 24  &ndash; literally <q>God’s face is upon
(above) us</q> is used  &ndash; that is, it refers to the Passion, Death,
Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ. The Old Testament holy
places were <q>images</q>, peculiar <q>representatives</q>, <q>types</q>, <q>copies</q> of
heavenly, real ones, that are closely connected with Christ.</p>
<p>Next, we talk about the power of the One Sacrifice of Christ in
comparison with the Old Testament sacrifices (in particular, here —
directly with the sacrifices of the high priest on the feast of each
year once a year).</p>
<p>The ministry of the Old Testament was thus a type, a sign of the
Sacrifice of Jesus.</p>
<p>Hebrews IX, 28 — <q>earnestly, with a real desire expect
salvation.</q></p>

<p><reading>(Mark VIII, 27-31) </reading>
</p>
<p>The disciples say that people considered Jesus to
be one of the prophets, perhaps the one who precedes the Messiah
(especially Elijah). People, not being really close to Jesus, compare
Him with those they know better (tested by time and the experience of
generations) — with prophets. But the disciples recognize Jesus (in the
person of Peter, who confessed it on their behalf, as Orthodox
Christians believe) as the Son of God. It is not so easy to understand
the concrete meaning of this confession, since only after the
Resurrection of Jesus and Pentecost did the disciples fully know Whom
Jesus is, but the revelation and acceptance (in particular revealed from
Father to Peter), as well as full knowledge and glorification (in the
Holy Spirit in power) — it is not the same thing. There is a certain
distance between them, which the apostles had to cross (literally and
figuratively), and they really passed it with God’s love and their
efforts.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a good essay about the further words of Jesus
at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="19032023.html">19032023.html</a></p>
<p>Once again, I draw attention to the fact that the Son is revealed by
the Father, in accordance with the fact that the Hypostases (Persons) of
the Trinity represent One Another and glorify One Another to others, to
people in particular.</p>
<p>There is a good parable on this topic with an explanation at the
link:

<p><reading>(Hebrews IX, 1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Old Testament holy places and services were
prototypes of the New Testament  &ndash; in particular, the ark  &ndash; according to
general opinion, is a prototype of the Mother of God (and the reading in
honour of Her holiday today), and priestly service is a prototype of the
Sacrifice and service of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The apostle does not delve into the details, they are established
rather easily after the above logic becomes clear  &ndash; he does not delve so
as not to distract from the main topic.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke X, 38-42, XI, 27-28) </reading>
</p>
<p>Reading on holidays in honour of the
Mother of God. Jesus’ words about Mary indicate the virtues of the
Mother of God and Her dignity.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is not superfluous to remind that the Lord does
not reject or devalue Martha’s work, but wants to highlight the purpose
and emphasize the meaning of His communication with them.</p>
<p>The meaning of His communication and friendship with them was
primarily not in a well-spent time, not in joy, not in joint activities,
work in particular, celebration, hospitality, but first of all  &ndash; in the
fact that it would teach the sisters to fulfill God’s will in the
similar way as He Himself fulfills it.</p>
<p>And this last is even more valuable than the opportunity to show
human and friendly hospitality at that time. More valuable, because
later exactly what they learned from Jesus they will be able to convey
to others (in particular, logically and presumably, there were no other
witnesses to this situation, except for the Three, and the two sisters
who were close to Jesus told about it) . And the Lord said more than
once that He came not to be served, but to serve others Himself.</p>
<p>In this sense, these words literally serve as one reading together
with the following words about God’s will already in relation to the
Mother of God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
