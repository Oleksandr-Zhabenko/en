<p><reading>(Romans VI, 18-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading directly, so
much of what is said about yesterdayâ€™s reading applies to todayâ€™s
reading:
<br><a class="link2" href="01072023.html">01072023.html</a></p>
<p>I will also add what I wrote about earlier: <q>In modern language, the
apostle would speak of â€˜the manipulation of sinâ€™, â€˜sin manipulates
peopleâ€™, which would be approximately the same thing, just in modern
language.</q></p>

<p><reading>(end of quote) </reading>
</p>

<p>Other places here, in my opinion, are quite eloquent and clear.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VIII, 5-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew VIII, 8, 9  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™.
It is used for emphasis. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautonâ€™  &ndash; (under) â€˜meâ€™.</p>
<p>About the faith of a Roman centurion and the healing of his sick
servant.</p>
<p>This passage is well known, but I will only emphasise certain
important points.</p>
<p><q>Jesus was amazed</q>  &ndash; there are different translations here, and there
are theological nuances to interpretation  &ndash; for example, if we translate
<q>was surprised</q>, we are talking about a human feeling, because as God He
knows everything and is not surprised; if we translate <q>amazed,
delighted</q>, <q>became much more lively</q>, then God is also extremely
pleased with personal human virtues  &ndash; and then these are both Godâ€™s and
humanâ€™s feelings (in the dimension of natures)  &ndash; in general, these are
the feelings of the Son of God due to the hypostatic unity of the two
natures in Him (His human feelings are also His personal feelings).</p>
<p>The <q>sons of the kingdom</q> are Jews, in general, those who know the
Law, the Scriptures, who are taught in them. It is not about all of
them, but about the fact that (surprisingly) there will be such among
them.</p>
<p><q>Of such great faith</q>  &ndash; we would say that the centurion first showed
faith and then humility when he did not consider himself worthy, but the
Lord generally says <q>faith</q>. Why is this? Because the centurionâ€™s
humility comes from his faith, is an organic continuation and component
of his faith, and the Lord looks at the heart and the essence of the
matter, so He speaks of faith.</p>
<p><q>In Israel</q>  &ndash; among those whom Christ saw while preaching. We can say
that the case of the centurion is similar to Jesusâ€™ praise of John the
Baptist. It is not a comparison of the two men whom the Lord praises,
but a special honour shown to them both. The Apostle Paul (at least for
the saved) says: <q>And to each one there will be praise from God</q> (1
Corinthians IV, 5), meaning that the Lord can bestow special gifts and
praise as many as He wishes, in the language of mathematics, it is a
non-linear structure, these gifts are different from each other, it is
difficult (and probably not necessary) to compare them, but all of them
will be enjoyed.</p>
<p>To the apostle Judas, the Lordâ€™s brother in the flesh: (Jude I, 1-10;
John XIV, 21-24) For the reading of the Apostle, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="21022023.html">21022023.html</a></p>
<p>Jude I, 3  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÏ€Î±Î³Ï‰Î½Î¹Î¶ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜epagonizesthaiâ€™  &ndash; â€˜to struggle
diligentlyâ€™.</p>
<p>Regarding the Gospel: John XIV, 21  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï†Î±Î½Î¹ÏƒÏ‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜empanisoâ€™  &ndash; â€˜I
will show, manifestâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myselfâ€™.</p>
<p>John XIV, 22  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï†Î±Î½Î¹Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emphanizeinâ€™  &ndash; â€˜to show, to
manifestâ€™.</p>
<p>John XIV, 24  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emosâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™ (word).</p>
<p>It says that the Lord will manifest Himself to the person who loves
Him and fulfils His will and commandments in this life. Manifestation
does not mean a special Revelation from God, a miraculous phenomenon,
but it means the establishment of a deeper relationship on the
initiative of God Himself. That is, the person may not even expect it,
but the Lord gives him or her His grace in one way or another. Such a
state shows that the person shows his or her love, but it is not a final
confirmation of it, nor is it a guarantee of salvation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this promise is valid until the time of the Second
Coming, when the Lord will be revealed to all.</p>
<p>It inspires great hope.</p>
<p><q>He will not appear to the world</q>  &ndash; because the world does not want
this deep relationship. It is about the fulfilment of the personâ€™s
(often) secret desire for the deep personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
