<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Paul says that God&amp;#39;s power in weakness reaches completion (or perfection, here is used a word which comes from end, goal). That is, human weakness can serve as a means of overcoming all temptations through the action of God&amp;#39;s power in this. One can say that on Paul&amp;#39;s example in this situation we see that for a person whom God strengthens and fortifies, to whom He gives strength, one&amp;#39;s own human weaknesses can serve then as a means of victory over temptations (and therefore also sins). One can say differently: if God strengthens a person, gives strength, then a strong person or weak person — can overcome temptations and sins through this God&amp;#39;s power. It is worth recalling that in the Old Testament there is a similar example — the Lord saved Israel from the Midianites through Gideon and 300 men, with a small number, so that later the Israelites would not boast that they conquered themselves, and not God conquered for them."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians XI, 31-XII, 9) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians XI, 31 — &#39;εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας&#39; - &#39;eis tous aionas&#39; - <q>unto the ages; for ever</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XI, 32 — &#39;ἐν Δαμασκῷ&#39; - &#39;en Damasko&#39; - <q>in Damascus</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XI, 33 — &#39;ἐν σαργάνῃ&#39; - &#39;en sargane&#39; - <q>in a basket</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 1 — &#39;εἰς ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις κυρίου&#39; - &#39;eis optasias kai apokalypseis kyriou&#39; - <q>unto visions and revelations of the Lord</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates movement towards visions and revelations.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 2, 3 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. &#39;ἐν σώματι&#39; - &#39;en somati&#39; - <q>in the body; with (by) the body</q>. Rather the first translation variant, since in the second case the soul and spirit are meant implicitly, for they together with the body also were there in such a case.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 4 — &#39;εἰς τὸν παράδεισον&#39; - &#39;eis ton paradeison&#39; - <q>into the paradise; to the paradise</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here where exactly Paul was taken (it is logical and generally accepted to think that he writes about himself).
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 5, 9 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις&#39; - &#39;en tais astheneiais&#39; - <q>in the weaknesses; with the weaknesses</q>. Both translation variants are possible — the first indicates that these circumstances are as if a background for the action of God&#39;s grace, which is truly important, and the second — that weaknesses themselves become an occasion for glory and praise, if they do not hinder or even help a person to be united with God&#39;s grace, with God.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 6 — &#39;εἰς ἐμὲ&#39; - &#39;eis eme&#39; - <q>in me</q>. Here by meaning <q>in whom?</q>. The meaing here emphasises that Paul wants to be evaluated by his activity and its results (by fruits), and not by attitude to Paul&#39;s personality. &#39;ἐξ ἐμοῦ&#39; - &#39;ex emou&#39; - <q>from me</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates from where a person hears the apostle&#39;s words when communicating with him.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 8 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; ἐμοῦ&#39; - &#39;ap emou&#39; - <q>from me</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that the apostle asked that that angel would completely leave him, entirely.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 9 — &#39;ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ&#39; - &#39;en astheneia&#39; - <q>in weakness; with weakness</q>. Rather the first translation variant, since the second contrasts God&#39;s power and human weakness, at the same time uniting them into one whole — this is to a certain degree contradictory.
</p>
<p>
About the work of the apostle Paul from his own lips. He praises himself, since this is needed for the salvation of brothers and sisters, and not for his glory or honour from people. Some people recognise only experience, therefore for such Paul speaks of his experience in the Holy Spirit. From chapter XI — about endurance and difficulties, sufferings and labour more bodily, in chapter XII — about spiritual things and God&#39;s revelations.
</p>
<p>
Also one can notice that Paul does not encourage anyone to praise themselves in a similar way, but speaks of himself <q>from the third person, from the side</q>, also in no other way could the Word of God be conveyed for those people.
</p>
<p>
Paul says that <q>God&#39;s power in weakness reaches completion</q> (or perfection, here is used a word which comes from <q>end, goal</q>). That is, human weakness can serve as a means of overcoming all temptations through the action of God&#39;s power in this. One can say that on Paul&#39;s example in this situation we see that for a person whom God strengthens and fortifies, to whom He gives strength, one&#39;s own human weaknesses can serve then as a means of victory over temptations (and therefore also sins). One can say differently: if God strengthens a person, gives strength, then a strong person or weak person — can overcome temptations and sins through this God&#39;s power. It is worth recalling that in the Old Testament there is a similar example — the Lord saved Israel from the Midianites through Gideon and 300 men, with a small number, so that later the Israelites would not boast that they conquered themselves, and not God conquered for them.
