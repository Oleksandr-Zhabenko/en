<p>Today there are as many as three readings, one of which is for Saint
Gregory Palamas, and one is for the Council of the Reverend Fathers of
Kyiv-Pechersk.</p>

<p><reading>(Hebrews I, 10  &ndash; II, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the daily Apostle it was read that
Christ (and the Holy Trinity in general) differs from creation very
essentially. Paul is addressing people who thought in terms of the
changeability of the world. But it is possible to say in a general way
that God is essentially different from all created things  &ndash; in whatever
respect we consider, He is essentially significantly different from
everything that we know from creation. This opinion is the basis of the
so-called apophatic theology, when instead of looking for analogues of
‘some God’s something’ among creation, in creation, people consciously
look at the depth of differences by which creation differs from God, and
He from creation. This way of thought, however, does not deny God’s love
for creation, nor care, nor the fact that God knows creation and
everything perfectly, nor does it deny that He reveals the truth,
particularly about Himself, in human words and in general — to people
(intelligent creation). This way of thought is called kataphatic
theology and exists together and alongside with apophatic theology.</p>
<p>For more thoughts on this topic and how it relates to people’s search
for God, see the good works at the links:

and others cited there.</p>
<p>And then the logical thought is that if even the actions and words of
the creation that the Lord sends to minister (holy angels) are of great
importance, then the Lord Himself is even more so.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark II, 1-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>About the healing of the paralyzed man by the faith
of those who cared for him.</p>
<p>Most often in the Scriptures, we see that the Lord heals and forgives
the sins of a person based on his / her OWN faith, and here we see that
He does the same based on the faith of OTHERS, a kind of intercessors
for this person.</p>
<p>This shows that it makes sense to ask God, Christ for mercy, even for
people who do not ask for it for themselves.</p>
<p>The paralytic did not turn to Jesus, but he did not deny that they
wanted to bring him to Him.</p>
<p>That is, it is not about a God-fighter: the paralytic did not speak
out against Christ, against his friends, but it is not evident whether
he believed in Jesus and that He would heal.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the forgiveness of sins, which shows here the divine
dignity of Jesus, there are good thoughts at the link, in the
reflections on the parable of the Last Judgment.
<br><a class="link2" href="19022023.html">19022023.html</a></p>
<p>The Gospel does not say that the Lord showed mercy to the paralytic’s
friends who showed faith. But this can be understood from the fact that
He fulfilled this faith, that He gave more than they expected, forgiving
the paralytic’s sins, that He <q>saw</q> (stared at, look thoroughly to be
more close to the literal meanings) their faith, that is, it was really
joyful for God Himself. God is pleased when people show love in this
way.</p>
<p>And what is important, the Lord does not hesitate to clearly show His
mercy, even though (some) people were tempted. And we need not be
ashamed to show faith, love and other virtues, even when someone may be
tempted about it.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
