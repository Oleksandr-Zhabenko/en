<p><reading>(Acts V, 21-33) </reading>
</p>
<p>The part where the apostles were imprisoned by the
Jews for their preaching is omitted, but an angel of God appeared to
them first in the prison and secretly led them out, telling them to
continue preaching about Christ, which they did.</p>
<p>The reading describes events that further perplexed the Jews, and
also reiterates Peterâ€™s words to the Jews in the case.</p>

<p><q>God of our fathers</q>  &ndash; the Father. In the New Testament, the apostles
often speak of the Resurrection of Christ saying that God (the Father)
raised the Son. But there are also many places where it is said that
Christ Himself was raised, as the Church says, <q>by the power of His
Godhead</q>. This is also an obvious indication that Christ is also God,
like the Father (generally one of the most important).</p>

<p><reading>(John VI, 14-27) </reading>
</p>
<p>The part about the miraculous feeding of more than
5,000 people with 5 loaves and 2 fish is omitted. The reading begins
with the fact that people saw this miracle.</p>
<p>In general, the reading shows a certain mystery of Jesus to the
people at that time. He arrives secretly from them in another area
(miraculously walking on water), and then does not explain Himself, but
continues His Divine preaching.</p>
<p>And for Christ, it was a way to move on to the preaching about the
bread of life, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the Communion.</p>
<p>The Lord evaded the desire of people to make Him king, because this
was not the way He served for the salvation of people. There is also a
lesson here for people.</p>
<p>The salvation of a person does not lie in living an interesting life
full of unusual deeds and events, adventures, and achieving success in
them, but in doing the will of God.</p>
<p>God is always interesting, always worthy of attention, always actual.
Therefore, even if a person has not had any visible adventures in life,
but has lived it with God (which means that he or she has overcome
temptations, done good, etc.), the value of his or her life lies in
getting closer to God and ultimately in reaching God  &ndash; that is, in
living in God.</p>
<p>It is God who <q>gathers our lives together, makes them whole</q>. And
moving away from God, a person will face the fact that his or her
holistic life will be <q>exchanged</q>, <q>spent</q>, <q>given away</q> for certain
events, for a certain set and sequence, which may not even be consistent
and holistic.</p>
<p>As the Lord says: <q>Whoever does not gather with Me scatters</q> (Luke
XI, 23).</p>
<p>As the Lord says in the synoptic Gospels: <q>Is not the soul greater
than food, and the body than clothing?</q> (Matthew VI, 25).</p>

<p>The way the Lord performs miracles, as well as the way the Sacraments
are performed, is mysterious, but the Lord does not need our knowledge
of mysteries, but openness to Godâ€™s actions. The Lord knows better than
(all) of us where and how to act, and He does it, but we need to be open
to God, to His actions.</p>
<p>The Lord also teaches us to value the eternal more than the
temporal.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
