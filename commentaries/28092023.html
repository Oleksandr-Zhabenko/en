<p><reading>(Ephesians IV, 14-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>Ephesians IV, 19  &ndash; ‘πλανης’  &ndash; ‘planes’ -
‘wandering, errors’.</p>
<p>Ephesians IV, 16  &ndash; ‘συναρμολογουμενον και συμβιβαζομενον’ -
‘synarologoumenon kai symbibazomenon’  &ndash; ‘was fit together and joined
together’.</p>
<p>The reading again shows the contrast between the life and development
of the Church of Christ and the pagan way of life. The authentic pagans
of that time were indeed alienated (far away) from the life of God (in
God), because they did not know the One true God, did not grow up in an
environment where God’s values were at least prevalent, so they lived
according to their own ideas of good and evil. The good pagans resembled
Christians to a certain significant degree, to a certain degree of
recognisability, and then often became them, but all the other pagans
lived according to their own efforts. Therefore, their consciousness was
occupied by passions along with good drives, and their lives were no
better than their consciousness. Not knowing God, they often indulged in
their own desires, passions, lusts, and eventually sins.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul writes about this state. Similar descriptions of
paganism and its supporters at that time are also found in other letters
of Paul, as well as in the ecumenical Epistles of the Apostles Peter and
Jude (Judas). As I wrote earlier, this state of affairs for the pagan
way of life still exists today, although mostly in the form of a
tendency, inclination, temptation, or opportunity.</p>
<p>With regard to the Church and the life of the faithful in God, we see
development and progress. The faithful have commandments, models, and
ideals that allow them to at least see when they are doing or thinking
well and when they are not. They have a goal and can always get closer
to it. This goal, these ideals, are indeed attainable, and the movement
towards them is fruitful and productive, led by Jesus Christ Himself,
the Head of the Church.</p>
<p>Paul says that growth occurs when the believers are <q>joined together
with every necessary bond</q>. In other words, the unity of the faithful in
the Church is not limited in terms of the means to achieve it.
Everything that is necessary for the unity of the faithful is included,
added to the development of the Church and the growth of the faithful in
Christ. The situation may seem ideal, but in the nearly two thousand
year history of the New Testament Church we see many examples of just
such an organic incorporation of what is needed for unity and growth
into the life of the Church. Paul writes that such things happen
according to God’s love, the love of the faithful, and mutual building
up.</p>

<p>Continuation of yesterday’s reading, which I wrote
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="27092023.html">27092023.html</a></p>
<p>It must be said that the dialogue with Jesus would have been the same
as the one concerning the baptism of John the Baptist, with the same
logic, if the high priests, scribes and elders had said something more
definite. This story also shows one of the reasons for John the
Baptist’s preaching and baptism.</p>
<p>I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XXI, 23-27)
with more explanations at the following link:
