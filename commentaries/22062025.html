(Romans II, 10-16) 
Romans II, 11 — 'Οὐ γάρ ἐστιν προσωπολημψία παρὰ τῷ θεῷ' - 'Ou gar estin prosopolempsia para to theo' - for there is no partiality in the vicinity of God. The preposition 'para' here with the dative case indicates here that nearness to God diminishes the differences between various social statuses, why one can say that the Lord Himself pays no attention to them at all in relationships with people. But on the contrary He turns His attention to the person themselves, and not to what people think or say about them. ἐν τῷ λαῷ' - 'en to lao' - in the human. Where. Here is the singular, which conveys two meanings — first, that the Lord healed people, was turned towards people, sought salvation and healing of people, and not something else; second — that Christ also by Himself, by His Incarnation saves the human being, restores human nature, and healing is a sign of such salvation."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans II, 10-16) </reading><br>
Romans II, 11 — 'Οὐ γάρ ἐστιν προσωπολημψία παρὰ τῷ θεῷ' - 'Ou gar estin prosopolempsia para to theo' - <q>for there is no partiality in the vicinity of God</q>. The preposition 'para' here with the dative case indicates here that nearness to God diminishes the differences between various social statuses, why one can say that the Lord Himself pays no attention to them at all in relationships with people. But on the contrary He turns His attention to the person themselves, and not to what people think or say about them.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 12 — 'ἐν νόμῳ' - 'en nomo' - <q>in the Law</q>. That is, accepting the Law of Moses and trying to observe it — here it concerns purely the internal convictions of the person, their conscience, and not belonging to a certain religious or political group. See verse 11.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 13 — 'παρὰ τῷ θεῷ' - 'para to theo' - <q>in the vicinity of God</q>. The preposition 'para' here with the dative case indicates here that if a person who hears the Law of Moses can evoke different attitudes among people, have different status, but near God it is not sufficient merely to hear the Law for righteousness, but it is necessary to <q>perform</q> it, to <q>create</q> (<q>do</q>) it (as poets write verses), in order to become more righteous, to act more justly, to go towards justification.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 15 — 'τὸ ἔργον τοῦ νόμου γραπτὸν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν' - 'to ergon tou nomou grapton en tais kardiais auton' - <q>the work of the Law written in their hearts</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 16 — 'ἐν ἡμέρᾳ' - 'en hemera' - <q>on the day; of the day</q>. When.

Matthew IV, 18 — 'παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν τῆς Γαλιλαίας' - 'para ten thalassan tes Galilaias' - <q>to the proximity with the Sea of Galilee</q>. That is, approaching the shore, coming to the shore. 'εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν' - 'eis ten thalassan' - <q>into the sea</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IV, 21 — 'ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ' - 'en to ploio' - <q>in the boat; in the ship; on the ship</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IV, 23 — 'ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ' - 'en hole te Galilaia' - <q>in all Galilee; throughout all Galilee</q>. Where. 'ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς αὐτῶν' - 'en tais synagogais auton' - <q>in their synagogues</q>. Where. 'ἐν τῷ λαῷ' - 'en to lao' - <q>in the human</q>. Where. Here is the singular, which conveys two meanings — first, that the Lord healed people, was turned towards people, sought salvation and healing of people, and not something else; second — that Christ also by Himself, by His Incarnation saves the human being, restores human nature, and healing is a sign of such salvation.
