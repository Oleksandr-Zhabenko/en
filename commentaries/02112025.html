it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<reading>(Galatians II, 16-20) </reading><br>
Galatians II, 16 — &#39;ἐξ ἔργων&#39; — &#39;ex ergon&#39; - <q>from works; from deeds</q>. That is, the apostle discusses the thought that righteousness is <q>a consequence of works</q> (that the cause of righteousness is works), and not of God&#39;s grace. &#39;εἰς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν&#39; - &#39;eis CHriston Iesoun&#39; - <q>into Christ Jesus</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here that true faith leads to Christ, Who is its Goal. &#39;ἐκ πίστεως&#39; - &#39;ek pisteos&#39; - <q>from faith; out of faith</q>.

<p>
Galatians II, 17 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. Emphasises that the Source and Cause of justification is Christ.
</p>
<p>
Galatians II, 20 — &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - &#39;en emoi&#39; - <q>in me</q>. &#39;ἐν σαρκί&#39; - &#39;en sarki&#39; - <q>in flesh</q>. It is meant — with the weaknesses of nature. &#39;ἐν πίστει&#39; - &#39;en pistei&#39; - <q>in faith; with faith</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first emphasises that faith embraces the whole life of the apostle and the faithful, and the second — that it itself is the driving force of life.
</p>
<p>
Similar words are in the Epistle to the Romans and the 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians (see in particular at the links above).

<reading>(Luke VIII, 5-15) </reading><br>
Luke VIII, 5, 12 — &#39;ἐν τῷ σπείρειν&#39; - &#39;en to speirein&#39; - <q>in sowing; during sowing</q>. &#39;παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν&#39; - &#39;para ten odon&#39; - <q>to the proximity with the roadd</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with accusative and indicates that the seed fell near the road, in the direction towards it.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 7 — &#39;ἐν μέσῳ&#39; - &#39;en meso&#39; - <q>in the middle</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 8 — &#39;εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθήν&#39; - &#39;eis ten gen ten agathen&#39; - <q>into good soil</q> (in the outcome, by results, in a broad sense). Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 10 — &#39;ἐν παραβολαῖς&#39; - &#39;en parabolais&#39; - <q>in parables; with parables</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, while the first emphasises that the truth has the form of parables, and the second — that the parable as such is suitable to teach well.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 12 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;apo tes kardias auton&#39; - <q>from their hearts</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here emphasises that it takes away completely, entirely, so that nothing remains.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 13 — &#39;ἐν καιρῷ&#39; - &#39;en kairo&#39; - <q>in time; during time</q>. Common expression. When.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 14 — &#39;εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας&#39; - &#39;eis tas akanthas&#39; - <q>into thorns</q>. Where to. &#39;ὑπὸ μεριμνῶν καὶ πλούτου καὶ ἡδονῶν τοῦ βίου πορευόμενοι συνπνίγοντα&#39; - &#39;hypo merimnon kai ploutou kai hedonon tou biou poreuomenoi synpnigonta&#39; - <q>by cares, and riches, and life&#39;s desires going utterly choked</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with genitive case and indicates what causes that choking in people, weakening of spiritual life and efforts — cares, riches, life&#39;s lusts; indirectly by context here also indicates that these latter often act as obstacles, empty <q>thorns</q>, which wound, but do not nourish the soul.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 15 — &#39;ἐν τῇ καλῇ γῇ&#39; - &#39;en te kale ge&#39; - <q>in the beautiful, to the higher degree good soil</q>. &#39;ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ&#39; - &#39;en kardia kale kai agathe&#39; - <q>in a heart beautiful, to a higher degree good and good by results, in general, as a whole</q>. Here the combination of <q>good</q> in different degrees of height and perfection indicates that a person first adheres with the heart strongly to the Word of God, and then continues in the good even in a time when there is no such enthusiasm and cheerfulness, energy, inspiration and inspiration. The Lord needs to be loved strongly, and then it is needed for the people to preserve this love not necessarily in the same elevated and high state, but in the good one. &#39;ἐν ὑπομονῇ&#39; - &#39;en hypomone&#39; - <q>in patience</q>. Continuation of the previous thought — patience is needed in the time of &#39;ἀγαθῇ&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The well-known parable about the sower with explanations of Jesus Himself. I will say here that in Luke the very text of the parable is somewhat shortened, but it is noticeable that he understands this parable as a description of the process of maturing and bearing fruit. Not all successfully pass this process to the end, although all to at least a small degree, but were included in it, all are called to that maturing in the Lord. The description shows what are the possible common obstacles for successful completion and bearing of many fruits. Such understanding is indicated, in particular, by the words of Luke VIII, 14-15, where there are words &#39;τελεσφορουσιν&#39; — &#39;telesphorousin&#39; - (do not) <q>reach maturity</q>, &#39;υπομονη&#39; - &#39;hypomone&#39; - <q>patient endurance, which requires time, constancy</q>.
