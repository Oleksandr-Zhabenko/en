<p><reading>(Romans XII:4-5, 15-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans XII, 17  &ndash; ‘προνοομενοι’ -
‘pronooumenoi’  &ndash; ‘thinking beforehand, provide’. Important words for
building (creating) peace.</p>
<p>Romans XII:19  &ndash; ‘Εμοι’  &ndash; ‘Emoi’  &ndash; ‘to Me’.</p>
<p>Romans XII, 21  &ndash; ‘νικω’  &ndash; ‘niko’  &ndash; (do not) <q>be subdued, be
overcome</q>. ‘νικα’  &ndash; ‘nika’  &ndash; ‘subdue, overcome’.</p>
<p>General guidelines for Christian life.</p>
<p>I will focus only on anger and revenge. I wrote more about this at
the following links:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="07062023.html">07062023.html</a><br>

<p><q>To give place to the anger of God</q> is actually what a Christian
needs to do with his or her own anger, if it is truly just. At the same
time, it is necessary to fight evil. In particular, in war, one must
stop evil (that is why the so-called <q>defensive, just war</q> is needed),
but one should not be emotionally angry with oneself.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XII, 9-13) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XII, 11  &ndash; ‘εμπεση’  &ndash; ‘empese’  &ndash; ‘would
have fallen’. ‘κρατησει’  &ndash; ‘kratesei’  &ndash; ‘will make an effort, show
strength’.</p>
<p>
(Paragraph added on 04/07/2023)<br>
As for the <q>coals on the head</q>, Paul is literally quoting from Proverbs XXV, 21-22. In the context of Paul's words, it is not about <q>making the enemy more painful</q>, but about the fact that 'coal on the head' is called a real good that the person (enemy) begins to realise and see against all odds. After all, the person can often feel and have hostility, prejudice (bias), anger and enmity because he or she does not realise that the other one is a Christian and what this really means. In this case, such a person, having seen, or better to say, having deeply felt the love of a Christian, will fall into a state of deep emotion or even shock, which is called 'coal'. Once upon a time, it was the charcoal from under the altar with which the lips of Isaiah were cleansed by the Seraphim. This is a purifying coal, the coal of love, and Paul says that it is better for a person to experience such a difficult and dramatic insight and enlightenment than to continue to hold on to evil, hostility, anger, or the like. If such a person is humane, he or she will cease to be an enemy and may even become a friend (Paul himself is a vivid example), and if not, he or she will at least try to change the relationship. If he or she does not do this, then he or she is really affected by sin, mastered by passions, blinded by them, and will have an even deeper insight and enlightenment later. See also: 1 Corinthians XIV, 22-25.
</p>
<p>Matthew XII, 13  &ndash; ‘απεκατεσταθη’  &ndash; ‘apekatestathe’  &ndash; ‘was restored to
its original state’ (healthy).</p>

<p>The Lord teaches us that the time is always right for true good.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
