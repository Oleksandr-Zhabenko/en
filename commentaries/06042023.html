<p><reading>(Isaiah LXV, 8-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>Isaiah, as an Old Testament man, prophesies about
God’s judgment and reward for the faithful.</p>
<p>Isaiah LXV, 10  &ndash; <q>valley</q>  &ndash; ‘emeq’ (pronounced like ‘emek’)  &ndash; a place
where you can renew your strength (moving in a mountainous area requires
effort, and a valley is a place where you can preserve and multiply,
increase, renew — an image understood by shepherds and residents of
areas where there is no plain).</p>
<p>To <q>leave the name</q> is to lose power, that is, in the Kingdom of God
evil people will lose all power.</p>
<p><q>Swear by name</q> is here synonymous with power (people swore as a sign
of certainty, and therefore of the power of their words). That is, in
the Kingdom of God, the faithful will have strength from God.</p>
<p>About swearing and strength see a good work by the link:<br>

</p>
<p>In part, this also applies to the New Testament, but completely  &ndash; in
the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis XLVI, 1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>As in another reading (see below), the Lord
appears to Jacob again and blesses him.</p>
<p>This is also fulfilled by the promise to Abram regarding the
resettlement of his descendants to Egypt (see:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="28032023.html">28032023.html</a><br> )</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs XXIII, 15  &ndash; XXIV, 5) </reading>
</p>
<p>Instructions are more widespread than
many previous ones, mainly against drunkenness, addiction to wine,
adultery, also against indulging in various passions, laziness. A call
to listen to the advice and guidance, especially elders (especially
parents), wisdom, mastery and decency.</p>
<p><q>Mother</q> is ‘em’, <q>truth, faithfulness, truth</q> is ‘emeth’
(‘eh-meth’).</p>
<p>Paremia of the Feast of the Annunciation (for tomorrow)</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis XXVIII, 10-17) </reading>
</p>
<p>Jacob’s miraculous dream, a vision of God.
The ladder is a prototype of the Mother of God, the Angels show that
through Her the earthly and heavenly will be united in the Lord, and
more precisely here  &ndash; in the Son of God.</p>
<p>Genesis XXVIII, 14  &ndash; <q>like the dust of the earth</q>  &ndash; compare the
explanation on the links:

<p><reading>(Ezekiel XLIII, 27  &ndash; XLIV, 4) </reading>
</p>
<p>The prophecy about the New Testament,
and then  &ndash; about the Incarnation of the Son of God and the virginity of
the Mother of God  &ndash; before Christmas, at Christmas and after Christmas -
in the image of a gate through which only the Lord, not a man,
passed.</p>
<p>The glory of the Lord here is the glory (gifted to) of the Mother of
God, who is higher than the angels.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs IX, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>One can see in Wisdom here the Son of God, and
her house is the Mother of God  &ndash; that is, the fact that the Mother of
God served the economy of God, the deed of saving people and building
the Church through serving the Incarnation of the Son of God and His
growth as a human.</p>
