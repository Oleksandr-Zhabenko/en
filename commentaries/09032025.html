it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Hebrews XI, 24-26, 32 &mdash; XII, 2) </reading><br>
Hebrews XI, 26 &mdash; ‘ἀπέβλεπεν γὰρ εἰς τὴν μισθαποδοσίαν’ - ‘apeblepen gar eis ten misthapodosian’ - ‘for he took his eyes away from everything but the recompense reward; for he looked only at the recompense reward’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates where Moses directed his attention and honour to. The verb has the prefix ‘ap’, which is derived from the preposition ‘apo’ and indicates a complete turning away from that.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Hebrews xii, 2 &mdash; ‘ἀφορῶντες εἰς τὸν τῆς πίστεως ἀρχηγὸν καὶ τελειωτὴν Ἰησοῦν’ - ‘aphorontes eis ton tes pisteos arkhegon kai teleioten Iesoun’ - ‘looking attentively to the Author and the Finisher (the Completer; The One who has made the faith complete, perfect, finished) of the faith - to Jesus’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates where to look, i.e. to Whom. ‘ἐν δεξιᾷ τε τοῦ θρόνου τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘en dexia te tou thronou tou theou’ - ‘at the right hand of the throne of God (the Father)’. That is, in the highest glory.

<p>
To the 40 Saint Martyrs of Sebastia:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews XII, 1-10; Matthew XX, 1-16) </reading><br>
For the first two verses of the reading from the Apostle, see the comments above.
</p>
<p>
For the rest, see below.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XII, 3 &mdash; ‘τὸν τοιαύτην ὑπομεμενηκότα ὑπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἀντιλογίαν’ - ‘ton toiauten hypomemenekota ypo ton amartolon eis heauton antilogian’ - ‘of Him, Who endured (suffered) such controversy (such disobedience, opposition) through the sinners in regard to Himself’. <br>
The preposition ‘ypo’ here is with the genitive case and indicates that Christ suffered from sinners, humbly endured what they did. To a certain extent, sinners are not active opponents here, but rather instruments of sin, and hence its victims, while Christ endures sin, suffering, and death, but is longsuffering towards people. Let us also remember Christ's prayer for His crucifiers on the cross.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XII, 5 &mdash; ‘μηδὲ ἐκλύου ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐλεγχόμενος' - <q>mede eklyou yp autou elenkhomenos</q> - <q>do not wander (do not falter, do not faint), being instructed (being rebuked or chastised) through Him</q>. The preposition ‘ypo’ in its form before the next vowel is with the genitive case here and indicates that the instruction is through the Lord, that the Lord is interacting with the person in that situation.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XII, 7 &mdash; ‘εἰς παιδίαν ὑπομένετε’ - ‘eis paidian hypomenete’ - ‘(come to a situation where) you endure educational reproof’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates a complex grammatical construction that means a transition to a new situation, desirable in view of the previous conditions, i.e. transition-realisation, transition-fulfilment - the apostle wants us to accept rebukes from God as children and treat them accordingly, without diminishing our love for God. The Lord wants our mature understanding.
</p>
<p>... Hebrews XII, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον εἰς τὸ μεταλαβεῖν τῆς ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ’ - ‘epi to sympheron eis to metalabein tes agiotetos autou’ - ‘for the benefit (for good) of the partaking of His holiness’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action.
