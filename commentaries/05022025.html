it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Peter IV, 1-11) </reading><br>
1 Peter IV, 2 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ μηκέτι’ - ‘eis to meketi’ - ‘so that no longer’. A common expression, the preposition ‘eis’ indicates purpose. ‘ἐν σαρκὶ’ - ‘en sarki’ - ‘in the flesh; with the flesh’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating a life of lust, and the second indicating that lust dominates.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἀσελγείαις’ - ‘en aselgeiais’ - ‘in licentiousness; in lasciviousness’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in which; from that’. This is the second translation. ‘εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν τῆς ἀσωτίας ἀνάχυσιν’ - ‘eis ten auten tes asotias anakhysin’ - ‘in the same outbursts of profligacy’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ’ - ‘eis touto gar’ - ‘for this reason also’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose of the action. 
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 7 &mdash; ‘εἰς προσευχάς’ - ‘eis proseukhas’ - ‘for high, spiritual prayers’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 8 &mdash; ‘τὴν εἰς ἑαυτοὺς ἀγάπην ἐκτενῆ ἔχοντες’ - ‘ten eis heautous agapen ektene ekhontes’ - ‘have strong (constant, great) love for one another’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of love.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 9 &mdash; ‘φιλόξενοι εἰς ἀλλήλους’ - ‘philoxenoi eis allelous’ - ‘be hospitable to one another’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of hospitality.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἑαυτοὺς’ - ‘eis heautous’ - ‘one for another; one to another’. Both translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter IV, 11 &mdash; ‘ὡς ἐξ ἰσχύος ἧς χορηγεῖ ὁ θεός’ - ‘hos ex iskhyos hes khoregei ho theos’ - ‘as from the power like the conducted choir by God’. The word emphasises coherence under God's guidance, multiplication of strength, and facilitation. For more information on the image of singing in alignment with God's grace, see the following translated text:
</p>
<p>
About singing of songs<br>
Grace grants a song. Why do people love songs so much? Music leads the soul and expresses what is poorly conveyed in words, something hidden, personal. That is why when a person sings in a choir or accompanied by music, their soul reveals itself in words, but also rests in melody and music, which reveals what is not expressed in words.
</p>
<p>
So is grace, near a person as music or a choir near a singer. It reveals what cannot be said in words. For example, King David plays the harp. And he sings. The harp reminds us of the synergy of the will of God and the will of man. The same can be said about choral singing. The voice of the singer against the sound of the choir is like a person next to God.

<reading>(Mark XII, 28-37) </reading><br>
Mark xii, 30 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας σου καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος σου’ - ‘ex holes tes kardias sou kai ex holes tes psykhes sou kai ex holes tes dianoias sou kai ex holes tes iskhyos sou’ - ‘from (out of) the whole your heart, and from (out of) the whole of your soul, and from (out of) the whole of your understanding (deep thought, comprehension, mind), and from (out of) the whole of your strength’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘ho’ indicates where this love is to come from and also emphasises that it is essential. To a certain extent: ‘You have a heart - let your love for God come from the whole of it! You have a soul - let love for God come from the whole of it! You have comprehension, understanding, and reason - let love for God come from all of them! You have strength, let love for God come from all of it!’ It is important to emphasise that the preposition used is not ‘en’, i.e. ‘’with what?‘’, but ‘ek’ (‘ex’), i.e. ‘’from where? This indicates that one cannot be ‘forced to love’ or ‘to use’ them for love, but must give freedom to the heart, soul, mind, and strength so that they may love God with it. ‘Let the children come to Me,’ says the Lord about this.
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 33 &mdash; ‘τὸ ἀγαπᾶν αὐτὸν ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς συνέσεως καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος’ - ‘to agapan auton ex holes tes kardias kai ex holes tes syneseos kai ex holes tes iskhyos’ - ‘to love Him from (out of) the whole heart, and from (out of) the whole understanding, and from (out of) the whole strength’. See above. It is noticeable that the lawyer understands all of these as human powers, whereas Christ shows more substantiality, each part of the named ones exists ‘more, more fully’.
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 34 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘apo tes basileias tou theou’ - ‘from the Kingdom of God’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is understood that the lawyer is not separated from the Kingdom of God, but can enter it.
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 35 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ’ - ‘en to hiero’ - ‘in the temple’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XII, 36 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ’ - ‘en to pneumati to agio’ - ‘in the Holy Spirit; by the Holy Spirit’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that the Holy Spirit speaks more than David himself, and the second that David cooperates with the Holy Spirit, consciously prophesying about the Son of God, and calling us to speak about Him. ‘κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου’ - ‘kathou ek dexion mou’ - ‘Sit at My right hand’. The preposition ‘ek’ is part of a common expression.
