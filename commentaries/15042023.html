<p>Regarding the descent of Jesus Christ to Hell  - endash see a good essay at
the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="08042023.html">08042023.html</a><br></p>

<p><reading>(1 Corinthians V, 6-8; Galatians III, 13-14) </reading>
</p>
<p>The meaning of reading
from the Epistle to the Corinthians is that the initial leaven changes
the general characteristics of the whole, so our attitude to the
celebration and in general to everything changes our entire celebration,
and we know it can change the whole life, of which this celebration is a
significant part.</p>
<p>And from the Epistle to the Galatians  - endash a brief thought, why the Lord
accomplished salvation in such a way. It is addressed to those who
accept the logic of the entire Epistle to the Galatians, so it does not
explain, but rather cements it in the mind and memory. <q>Abrahamâ€™s
blessing</q>  - endash a comparison with the continuation shows that it is a <q>gift
of the Holy Spirit (the Holy Spirit Himself) through faith</q>, which in
turn, according to the logic of the blessing, means that all nations
(but not all people!) will receive this gift through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXVII, 62-66) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew gives more details about the Jewish
elders who wanted to justify their actions in the future. This event
also has a parallel  - endash before the descent of the Graceful Light (fire),
on Great Saturday, the Kuvuklia is sealed so that no one gets there
early.</p>
<p><q>watch three days</q>  - endash the literalism of the Jews is obvious,
regardless of their unbelief  - endash since Christ spoke of <q>three days and
three nights</q> (about which there is a good post at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02M5K7yLfNysyNTbu41X4bxrei32Topm2dqnjjiLtropcMtMdemK4yHMGTFtxdpqykl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02M5K7yLfNysyNTbu41X4bxrei32Topm2dqnjjiLtropcMtMdemK4yHMGTFtxdpqykl</a><br>
), then the Jews do not ask for a guard for a longer time. They are not
at all afraid that the apostles <q>can steal the body on the 4th day or
later</q>, because the words of Jesus will be violated.</p>
<p>At the same time, all human attempts to prevent the fulfillment of
Godâ€™s words in the end only serve to confirm the validity of the
latter.</p>

<p><reading>(Romans VI, 3-11) </reading>
</p>
<p><q>baptism into</q>  - endash the preposition ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ is used  - endash that
is, <q>(to, into) where</q> the action, movement, etc. takes place.</p>
<p>Romans VI, 6  - endash <q>might be done away with</q>  - endash literally <q>to make
completely idle, inactive</q>, that is, so that sins completely cease to
act in people. <q>Death and mortification of sins</q> before the general
resurrection means not their complete disappearance, not their change
and transformation into something else, but their complete inactivity,
lack of movement, and therefore power and influence.</p>
<p>Romans VI, 11  - endash <q>to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Jesus</q>
- that is, literally <q>having stopped, ceased the actions of sin, to give
free will, freedom to (of) life to move to God in Christ, through
Christ.</q></p>
<p>It is also important to understand that a person <q>never stands still</q>
and is always in motion.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXVIII, 1-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading serves as an <q>announcement of
tomorrowâ€™s event</q>, since today is already a joyful expectation. About
the watchman, see the opinion above. Now I will not dwell on the
evidence of the Resurrection of Jesus, there is a lot of literature and
research about it. There is even the Shroud of Turin, the authenticity
of which is still unclear, but it also encourages belief in the truth of
this Resurrection.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
