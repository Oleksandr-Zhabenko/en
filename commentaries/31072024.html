<reading>(1 Corinthians II, 9 — III, 8 ) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians II:10 &mdash; ‘ἡμῖν’ - ‘emin’ - ‘to us’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians II:11 &mdash; ἐν αὐτῷ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in him’.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians II, 12, 16 &mdash; ‘ἡμεῖς’ - ‘emeis’ - ‘we’. ‘τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘to pneuma to ek tou theou’ - ‘the Spirit Who (proceeds) from God’. ‘εἰδῶμεν τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ χαρισθέντα ἡμῖν’ - ‘eidomen ta ypo tou theou kharisthenta emin’ - ‘(we) knew what was given to us from God’. The difference between the prepositions, which are both translated in Ukrainian, Slavic and other languages by the same word, and in Greek use different words to convey different meanings, is important here. The Holy Spirit, of Whom the former is spoken, is ‘from God’ (the Father) differently from ‘those things which are given to us’. The preposition ‘ek’ here emphasises the essential proceeding of the Holy Spirit as the Hypostasis of the Holy Trinity from the Father, which is in Greek ‘para tou patros’. And the preposition ‘ypo’ means creation and subordination, inferiority, subjection of all other gifts of God to God. So, these are two different realities - the gift of the Holy Spirit, the Third Hypostasis of the Holy Trinity, and all other gifts from God. The first has no limit and can raise a person above all creation to deification, to infinity, to God, while the second has a measure and limits like all creation, including people themselves, but even this, being given by God to a person, reveals God's great love. The former is the boundless and endless Path, and the latter is what one encounters on this Path. See also more at the links:<br>

<p>
This part of the reading is also a vivid testimony to the fact that the Holy Spirit is a Hypostasis, a Person, God.

<p>
1 Corinthians II, 13 &mdash; ‘ἐν διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας λόγοις’ - ‘en didaktois anthropines sophias logois’ - ‘in the learned words of human wisdom’. ‘ἐν διδακτοῖς πνεύματος’ - ‘en didiktois pneumatos’ - literally ‘by the learned of the Spirit; in the learned of the Spirit’. Both translations are correct, but the first is more common.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians III:1 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ’ - ‘en CHristo’ - ‘in Christ’. 
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians III, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘en ymin’ - ‘in you; among you; between you’.

<p>
<reading>(Matthew XIII, 31-36) </reading><br>
Matthew XIII, 31 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ’ - ‘en to agro’ - ‘in the field’. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIII, 32 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις’ - ‘en tois kladois’ - ‘in the branches’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIII, 33 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἀλεύρου σάτα τρία’ - ‘eis aleurou sata tria’ - ‘’into three sata (measures; sata is a measure of bulk products, substances and materials, in particular flour) of flour’. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIII, 34, 35 &mdash; ‘ἐν παραβολαῖς’ - ‘en parabolais’ - ‘in parables; with parables’. Both versions are correct, although they have slightly different meanings. The first one means that Jesus used a parable as a form of conveying teaching content, and the second one means that the parable itself also teaches through its direct literal meaning. The second option describes the situation more fully and is therefore preferable. ‘χωρὶς παραβολῆς’ - ‘khoris paraboles’ - ‘without a parable; apart from a parable’. The second translation says that Jesus did not speak in ‘lectures’ but always gave wonderful illustrations and parables as a form of teaching and memorisation. The former emphasises that parables were added organically and constantly.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIII, 35 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ καταβολῆς’ - ‘apo kataboles’ - ‘from the foundation; from the beginning’. That is, important secrets that are relevant at all times. In other words, ‘universal’.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIII, 36 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν’ - ‘eis ten oikian’ - ‘into the house; home’. ‘ἡμῖν’ - ‘emin’ - ‘to us’.
