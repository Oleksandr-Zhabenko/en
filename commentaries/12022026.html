it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 John IV, 20-V, 21) </reading><br>
1 John IV, 21 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that this is a gift.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 1, 4, 18 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;ek tou theou&#39; - <q>from God</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates that such a person is God&#39;s child, comes from God as a creation and a person who becomes like the Son of God through the gift of grace. &#39;ἐξ αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;ex autou&#39; - <q>from Him</q>. Indicates here the eternal begetting of the Son of God from the Father. See also at the link and others cited there:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19022025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19022025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 2 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; — &#39;en touto&#39; - <q>in that; with that</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 6 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ὕδατι&#39; — &#39;en to hydati&#39; - <q>in water; with water</q>. Logically the second, since it is unclear what the first would mean regarding Christ. &#39;ἐν τῷ αἵματι&#39; - &#39;en to haimati&#39; - <q>in blood; with blood</q>. Analogously to the previous — the second variant is logically better.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 8 — &#39;οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσιν&#39; — &#39;hoi treis eis to hen eisin&#39; - <q>(these) three into one are</q>. That is, their testimony is not only in agreement, but is a single testimony.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 10 — &#39;πιστεύων εἰς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;pisteuon eis ton hyion tou theou&#39; - <q>believes into the Son of God</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates that true faith leads to Christ, He is its Goal. &#39;ἐν αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en auto&#39; - <q>in him; in Him</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, although traditionally we have the first variant. &#39;εἰς τὴν μαρτυρίαν&#39; - &#39;eis ten martyrian&#39; - <q>into the testimony</q>. Analogously here faith in the testimony must make the person a manifestation of Christ, an image of the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 11 — &#39;ἐν τῷ υἱῷ&#39; — &#39;en to hyio&#39; - <q>in the Son; with the Son</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates Who is the Source and the Summit of that life, and the second emphasises the fact that Christ grants and moves such life.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 13 — &#39;εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;eis to onoma tou hyiou tou theou&#39; - <q>into the name of the Son of God</q>. Analogously to verse 10 above, it is spoken of becoming Christ&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 14 — &#39;παρρησία&#39; — &#39;parresia&#39; - <q>boldness, courage, freedom, confidence</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 15 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;ap autou&#39; - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that this is a gift which the faithful strive to obtain.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 19 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;ek tou theou&#39; - <q>from God</q>. See above, also here it is spoken of the fact that God is the Source of the life of the faithful in many senses. &#39;ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ&#39; - &#39;ek to ponero&#39; - <q>in evil (in total, as a result, overall); in wickedness</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, moreover the first indicates sins, and the second — the state of self-deception, when the world deceives itself and tries to deceive the faithful.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 20 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἀληθινῷ, ἐν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ&#39; — &#39;en to alethino, en to hyio autou Iesou CHristo&#39; - <q>in the true, in His Son Jesus Christ; in the True One, in His Son Jesus Christ</q>. Different variants of translation are possible, in the first under the true is understood the truth revealed by God, God&#39;s Revelation, and in the second — the Father (the Son and the Spirit are also True).
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 21 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων&#39; — &#39;apo ton eidolon&#39; - <q>from the idols</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that it is necessary to guard completely, entirely, altogether.
</p>
<p>
Several very meaningful parts, about each some short comments.
</p>
<p>
Regarding 1 John IV, 20-21: often people think that in love good impressions are more important, and not the possibility to act well for someone. It seems to them that it is simpler (easier) to love God (about Whom they have an idea as about a Good God and He is truly Good, Gracious, although His Goodness and Righteousness can differ substantially from how people imagine them), than to love close in this or that relation people to whom directly one can do good. John says that in reality it is the opposite. True love is possible even when a person does not make a pleasant impression, but it cannot give birth to bad actions. Actions, thus, are more important. In the end, the question reduces to what is more important for love — thoughts or actions. John says that actions. As an argument one can bring the thought that Christ (God) accepts upon Himself that which we do to people, but even in such a sense the significance of a person does not disappear, but on the contrary — becomes even more obvious. For it is one thing when someone does something <q>simply</q> to a person, but another — when a person realises that they are doing not <q>simply</q> to a person, but also to Christ. The significance of <q>simply</q> a person does not diminish, but becomes more obvious.
</p>
<p>
Regarding 1 John V, 1-5: about what strength is given to Christians by faith in Christ and life according to faith and commandments. If to paraphrase, faith in Christ gives people the possibility to fulfil His commandments, manifesting this and perfecting themselves in love. God&#39;s commandments are not heavy — not burdensome for a person who resolutely and without double-mindedness fulfils them. This testifies to their origin from the Creator of humanity. On this occasion there is a short prayer: <q>Jesus, grant me with all my heart to feel the lightness of Thy burden</q>.
</p>
<p>
Regarding 1 John V, 6-13: about Christian courage — to believe, to trust and to entrust oneself entirely to Jesus Christ. Some people are afraid to believe, bringing various (in reality incorrect) reasons. John by personal address encourages the faithful on their path to Christ. I will note that a part of two verses 7-8 is absent in some ancient texts of the Epistle, therefore many researchers consider it a possible insertion already by John&#39;s disciples.
</p>
<p>
Regarding 1 John V, 14-15: the word <q>to hear</q>, as many key words in Scripture has several meanings, is polysemous (compare, for example, with the words <q>faith, to believe</q>), here it is spoken of <q>will accept what is heard for fulfilment</q> (analogy with a state official who begins to fulfil some decision — but before this decision begins to be fulfilled, significant work on its preparation and adoption may be done). God fulfils that which we ask according to that which He wants to do, moreover, He Himself calls forth in us the desire to ask Him about this. More about that is in the work <q>On the Power of Human</q> at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Regarding 1 John V, 16-17: about <q>non-mortal</q> sins (mistakes which do not destroy communion with God, but harm it) and prayer. To neglect such mistakes is impossible, but they must not <q>take away</q> the joy of life in Christ. The best in such case manifestation of attention regarding them — is sincere prayer.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the ending of the Epistle: summary, short theses, and also final warning, that is, the <q>content</q> of the Epistle and the key task for writing.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark XV, 1-15) </reading><br>
Mark XV, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῇ στάσει&#39; — &#39;en te stasei&#39; - <q>in the insurrection</q>. The word is polysemous, here by the sense such a variant of translation.
</p>
<p>
About the final trial over Jesus at Pontius Pilate. From other Gospels we have more details. A very meaningful place. In general about the trial at Pontius Pilate there is a work at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Vlada.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Vlada.html</a><br>
Mark emphasises prudence (as a strong trait), but at the same time pliability and dependence of Pilate (as a real weakness). The latter is used by the Jews.
