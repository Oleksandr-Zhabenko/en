it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Galatians VI, 11-18 ) </reading><br>
Galatians VI, 12 &mdash; ‘εὐπροσωπῆσαι ἐν σαρκί’ - ‘euprosopesai en sarki’ - ‘to have a fair appearance in the flesh; to look good with the flesh’. Both translations are possible. That is, to give primary importance to the flesh. Paul is not speaking against fleshly beauty (since he is talking about circumcision, which is not displayed), but about the exclusive importance that his opponents attached to ritual circumcision and, in general, to rules for the flesh, neglecting the spiritual, as represented by the cross of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Galatians VI, 13 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ὑμετέρᾳ σαρκὶ’ - ‘en te hymetera sarki’ - ‘in your flesh; by your flesh’. That is, to make your flesh the basis of praise for themselves and for you.
</p>
<p>
Galatians VI, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ σταυρῷ’ - ‘en to stauro’ - ‘in the cross; with the cross’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating Paul's being in the effect of the Lord's cross, in redemption and salvation, and the second indicating that the cross of Christ itself is the basis for the praise of the faithful, that is, it reveals their dignity, worth, value in the eyes of God (for the cross is a direct testimony to God's love, how the Lord values the salvation of people), and is the reason why it is worth being Christians.
</p>
<p>
Galatians VI, 17 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ σώματί’ - ‘en to somati’ - ‘in the body’. Here it is not ‘flesh’ but ‘body’. Often these are synonymous, but the difference can also mean that the suffering for Christ, like His wounds, has significance after the Resurrection. That is, the suffering and wounds for Christ will be glorified after the general resurrection. Hence the special veneration of the wounds of the martyrs.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIII, 10-17) </reading><br>
Luke XIII, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν μιᾷ τῶν συναγωγῶν ἐν τοῖς σάββασιν’ - ‘en mia ton synagogon en tois sabbasin’ - ‘in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 11 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ παντελές’ - ‘eis to panteles’ - ‘completely, to the fullest’. A common expression that here describes the disease.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 12 &mdash; ‘[ἀπὸ] τῆς ἀσθενείας’ - ‘[apo] tes astheneias’ - ‘from the disease’. The preposition ‘apo’, which is absent in some manuscripts but is anyway present in the verb as a prefix, emphasises complete, full healing, deliverance from illness.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν αἷς’ - ‘en hais’ - ‘in which’. ‘ἐν αὐταῖς’ - ‘en autais’ - ‘in these’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 15 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς φάτνης’ - ‘apo tes phatnes’ - ‘from the stall’. The preposition ‘apo’ here emphasises that the donkey ‘leaves the stall’, goes away from it.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 16 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ δεσμοῦ’ - ‘apo tou desmou’ - ‘from the chains’. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises here that the woman is to be freed from what binds her, restrains her, her illness.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIII, 17 &mdash; ‘ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>yp autou</q> - <q>under Him; through Him</q>. The preposition ‘para’ here, in the form before the next vowel and with the genitive case, emphasises that the works were done by Christ, i.e. it is actually used for the passive voice of a verb to describe works.
