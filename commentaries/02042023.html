<p><reading>(Hebrews IX, 11-14) </reading>
</p>
<p>Hebrews IX, 12  &ndash; <q>made eternal redemption</q> -
literally <q>found (a common root word from "Eureka!" and "heuristics")
eternal redemption</q>  &ndash; that is, Christ did not decide in an ultimate form
(but as God He could do that), not <q>neglecting some important points</q>,
but <q>taking into account the position of all parties</q>, as a wise Judge
or Researcher  &ndash; the Lord <q>settled all problems</q>, <q>found a solution that
takes everything into account, for all! forever! for all generations!
for eternity!</q> — so, in particular, the human who was defeated by the
evil one, himself / herself (here, it is spoken about the human nature
common to both male and female humans) defeated the evil one in Him.</p>
<p>Hebrews IX, 14  &ndash; <q>With the eternal Spirit brought Himself, blameless,
to God (the Father)</q>  &ndash; literally  &ndash; <q>through the Spirit (as an
instrument, as a way of implementation) brought Himself…</q>  &ndash; that is,
Christ accomplished the salvation of people so that this salvation would
be accomplished by the Holy Spirit  &ndash; in the grace of the Holy Spirit,
through the action of the Holy Spirit, in conjunction with Him, in the
Holy Spirit. This is important for the Sacraments, for the Church, in
general for all people.</p>
<p>In general, the reading shows the uncomparable supremacy of the
Sacrifice of Christ over the Old Testament types, at the same time it
shows their connection and the causality of the types in that they point
to Christ.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark X, 32-45) </reading>
</p>
<p>Jesus foretells His Sufferings, Death and
Resurrection in advance, but the apostles did not understand this.</p>
<p>Instead, two of them, one of the closest to Jesus, James and John,
ask for a special honour for them.</p>
<p>Jesus’ question, according to the general opinion, shows that they do
not understand what He is talking about, and then He directly tells them
that we should not ask Him for honour  &ndash; seek it as Christians.</p>
<p>More explanations can be found in a good article at the link:

<a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid029LAQTY9RJnwewjyzjX7pPu7r1TJh3yc7wbUtqaGuFRMYqXLFfRhetvtHB7JSrMvZl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>There, in particular, it is spoken about the features of translation
that affect understanding, and it is explained this issue in depth (to
the possible extent).</p>

<p><reading>(Galatians III, 23-29) </reading>
</p>
<p>A very meaningful reading, which shows that
the Law of Moses was given as a <q>watchman</q>, as a <q>guide</q>, which was to
guard with the intention of waiting for the coming of faith  &ndash; that is,
the coming of Christ the Savior and salvation through faith.</p>
<p>Galatians III, 26  &ndash; <q>you are all sons of God through faith in Jesus
Christ</q> (<q>through</q> here means a kind of way of fulfillment, a <q>channel</q>
through which it happens), that is, by faith in Christ, the faithful are
children of God (<q>sons</q> is used here, but similarly <q>daughters</q>, and in
general  &ndash; <q>children</q>).</p>
<p>And this is accomplished through Baptism, not through physical birth
from Jesus. Here we see that the imitation of God’s promise to Abraham
(about which there were readings this week on weekdays) occurs through
union with Christ. The way of uniting is being taken wholely is beyond
human understanding, but almost the entire Christian theology is devoted
to many aspects that can be understood (so I will not repeat them here -
at least due to lack of space and time).</p>
<p>I would like to point out that the <q>application</q> of God’s gift of
salvation in Christ and promises, as well as <q>becoming children also of
Abraham according to the promise</q> does not occur through bodily birth
(descent) from Abraham, but through Christ in another way.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the content of the reflection on
whether the Scriptures necessarily require us to think that all must be
descended from Adam in the flesh in order to bear the consequences of
sin.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VII, 36  &ndash; 50) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading is dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt,
whose memory was today, who is an example of repentance, God’s great
mercy and help to those people who truly repent and correct
themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the reading itself, see reflections at the link:
