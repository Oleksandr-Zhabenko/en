<p><reading>(Isaiah LXVI, 10-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>Prophecy about the New Testament, about joy in
Christ the Savior, but also about judgment over sin, also about the
Kingdom of God and Godâ€™s Last Judgment, the completion of the book of
the prophet Isaiah  &ndash; as a certain summary of the main topics.</p>
<p>Isaiah XLVI, 13  &ndash; <q>mother</q>  &ndash; â€˜emâ€™, <q>comfort</q>  &ndash; comes literally from
<q>sigh (expressing love)</q>,  &ndash; in relation to God  &ndash; a symbol of the gift of
the Holy Spirit  &ndash; the Comforter, Paraclete.</p>
<p>The completion of the book may mean a prophecy that the words of the
book of the prophet will be read during the <q>Sabbaths</q>, that is, the
Lordâ€™s days, and therefore in connection with Easter, during the Great
Lent, which is happening now, to warn against sins.</p>

<p><reading>(Genesis XLIX, 33  &ndash; L, 26) </reading>
</p>
<p>The end of the lives of Jacob and Joseph.
Prophecies and obligations. The brothersâ€™ repentance before Joseph
himself, his mercifulness, repetition of words about Godâ€™s Providence.

<p>Egyptian embalmers (pagans) embalmed Jacobâ€™s body  &ndash; an expression of
the fact that there is nothing extraordinary or absolutely unchanged in
the rite of traditional burial, but what is first of all  &ndash; an expression
of love and respect for the deceased person.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be remembered that peopleâ€™s bodies will
be raised, and therefore the burial should take place with faith and
memory of this future fact.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs XXXI, 8-32) </reading>
</p>
<p>A call to wisdom and righteousness, especially
necessary for rulers (leaders), for whom the book is directly written,
but also for all.</p>
<p>The end of the book is an image and at the same time a wish of a
father to his son  &ndash; a wise and intelligent woman (wife, mother of
children, grandmother of grandchildren, beautiful, housewife, hard
worker, moderate and virtuous, etc.). The image corresponds to the style
of life at that time, its time, but has a lot of importance also
now.</p>
<p>Paremia, the feast of the Annunciation of the Most Holy Theotokos.<br>
<reading>(Exodus III, 1-8 ) </reading>
<br>
The appearance (manifestation) of the Lord in the form
of a bush that does not burn  &ndash; the Unburnt Bush  &ndash; is a prototype of the
Incarnation of the Son of God, while the bush itself is a prototype of
the Mother of God, Who contained God, the Only Begotten Son of God,
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As in the case of Abraham, as well as Jacob, the Angel here turns out
to be the Lord God  &ndash; this is an indication of the Son of God and the
Holy Spirit  &ndash; the Holy Spirit attracted Mosesâ€™ attention with fire, and
the Son of God was shown. In general, one can often think about the fact
that when God appears and calls Himself the God of the three patriarchs,
as here, then the entire Trinity appears (speaks) mysteriously, and
accordingly the Three Hypostases (the Persons of the Trinity) correspond
to the three patriarchs  &ndash; Abraham  &ndash; to the Father, to Isaac  &ndash; to the
Son, and Jacob to the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs VIII, 22-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading is a continuation of the another
reading which was considered of at the link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="13032023.html">13032023.html</a></p>
<p>The reading text itself is very difficult to understand, much has
been written about it. It must be said that back in the days of the
Arians, the latter tried to use it, misunderstanding that the text
testifies to the creation of the Son of God and to the fact that He is
not God, unlikely that the Father is God.</p>
<p>The simultaneous connection of Wisdom in this text with eternity
(with God) and with creation in time indicates that the most important
thing here is not about the Son of God Himself, but about Godâ€™s
designing creative thought, briefly Godâ€™s design, for the creation of
the world, which preceded the creation of the world itself (therefore,
it is from eternity, because time is also created). According to this
design, God created the world. And in this wise design, the Incarnation
of the Son of God was already foreseen  &ndash; God knew that it would happen.
And that is why the reading is especially relevant on the feast of the
Annunciation, when Godâ€™s design was fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is clearly evidenced by the troparion (a prayer with a summary
of the holiday), in which this wisdom is called the <q>Eternal Mystery</q>
(before any time, <q>ages</q>, any creation)  &ndash; <q>Today is the beginning of our
salvation, the revelation of the eternal mystery! The Son of God becomes
the Son of the Virgin as Gabriel announces the coming of Graceâ€¦</q>.</p>

<p><reading>(Hebrews II, 11-18) </reading>
</p>
<p>Here it is briefly told about the meaning of the
Incarnation of the Son of God  &ndash; about the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
about salvation, delivering, becoming children of God by grace for the
faithful, about Godâ€™s power and help in carrying out Godâ€™s will, about
victory over sins, the devil and death, the fulfillment of promises,
etc.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke I, 24-38) </reading>
</p>
<p>A story about the actual event of the holiday. Well
known and commented on a lot.</p>
<p>Today I want to draw attention to the following thoughts at the link:
