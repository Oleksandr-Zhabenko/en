<p>A meaningful theological place, a continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading
in terms of content:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="31072023.html">31072023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul explains what it means to be members of the Body of Christ in
terms of the manifestations of Godâ€™s gifts and ministries, as well as
mutual need in the Church, the community of believers.</p>
<p>The explanation is very eloquent if we understand it as a kind of
comparison of people with parts of the body, and the Church (generally
speaking, this means each local congregation of the Church, from which
the concept of the Local Church later originated) as a whole as the
whole body. I would also add that the word <q>catholic</q> in the Creed, in
Greek ÎºÎ±Î¸Î¿Î»Î¹ÎºÎ® (ÎµÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏƒÎ¯Î±), originally meant having the fullness of
spiritual gifts and ministries necessary for the salvation of people,
according to at least some researchers.</p>
<p>The unusual way the body parts speak of themselves also indicates
that God cares for all the body parts, even though they may not fully
understand their vocation, also during their search. The above
considerations of the parts of the body are possible at a time when they
(i.e., the people) are in a state of searching for themselves in the
Church. God cares for them also at this time.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that spiritual gifts are given to members of
the Church even when they do not know what they are, and even when they
do not understand what their spiritual gifts are. This generosity of God
is necessary for their own development, growth, knowledge of God, and
for serving others even before they realise their gifts. God wants
people to know Him, to know themselves, to know others, to know and
recognise their gifts and the gifts of others, but He often gives them
before this last happens, so in advance, in a providential way.</p>
<p>And the second thought is that although different parts of the body
have different gifts and ministries, there is no one part of the body
that performs the functions of all the others.</p>
<p>All this is for the building up of the Church as the Body of
Christ.</p>

</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 19 -
â€˜ÏƒÏ…Î¼Ï†Ï‰Î½Î·ÏƒÏ‰ÏƒÎ¹Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜symphonesosinâ€™  &ndash; <q>will be in harmony, (figuratively)
in accord, in consent</q>.</p>
<p>Matthew XVIII, 20  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; <q>My</q>. â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I)
â€˜amâ€™. It is used for emphasis.</p>

<p>There is a good start to the reading here:

<p>The next is about forgiveness. This is followed by a parable that
explains the idea in more detail (and is read alone at a different
time).</p>
<p>Then there is a brief discussion of the sermon and the miracles, and
then the continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="31072023.html">31072023.html</a></p>
<p>The second feature worth learning from little children is their
interest and desire to learn, to develop, to grow. <q>Do not forbid them</q>
implies that they want to learn, grow, develop, etc. Therefore, little
children are a vivid and widespread visual example of what the desires
of true believers should be in this sense, what people who truly want to
enter the Kingdom of God are like. <q>Of such is the Kingdom of God</q>
therefore also means that no one is dragged into the Kingdom of God by
force, but everyone who will be there will be voluntarily.</p>
