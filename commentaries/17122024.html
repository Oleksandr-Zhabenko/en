it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(1 Timothy I, 8-14) </reading><br>
1 Timothy I, 12 &mdash; ‘εἰς διακονίαν’ - ‘eis diakonian’ - ‘for the ministry’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 13 &mdash; ‘ἀγνοῶν ἐποίησα ἐν ἀπιστίᾳ’ - ‘agnoon epoiesa en apistia’ - ‘(being) the ignorant did this in unbelief; (being) the one who had no knowledge did this in unbelief’. There are different translations that can be used, and they complement each other. I would like to point out that here, quite obviously, knowledge and faith are not opposed in any way, they are largely synonymous, so that ignorance and unbelief act together as the basis of evil ’work,’ that is, sinful living and going deeper into it.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 14 &mdash; ‘τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘tes en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘those which are in Christ Jesus’. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark X, 2-12) </reading><br>
Mark X, 6 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ δὲ ἀρχῆς’ - ‘apo de arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning, the point in time from which the countdown for what is described begins.
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 8 &mdash; ‘οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν’ - ‘oi dyo eis sarka mian’ - ‘the two into one flesh; the two for one flesh’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates movement and transformation, or the purpose - that the two become one flesh. The words ‘flesh’ and ‘body’ are often used synonymously, but also here it can mean that the marriage is referred to as an earthly union, not a heavenly one, and therefore these words refer to all legal, even unconsecrated, marriages of a man and a woman (the Apostle Paul in his Epistles develops the thought in such a way that he compares marriage to the Mystery of Christ and the Church, using the word ‘Body’, and on the other hand speaks of a bodily unity that takes place even in cases of sins and trespasses).
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν’ - ‘eis ten oikian’ - ‘(coming) into the house; in the house; at home’.
