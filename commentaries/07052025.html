it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts VIII, 18-25) </reading><br>
Acts VIII, 20 — ‘εἴη εἰς ἀπώλειαν’ - ‘eie eis apoleian’ - ‘let it be unto loss’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here that such behaviour (called simony by this story, after the name of the magician Simon) will lead to loss, and Peter does not want loss, but rather that the magician (and all other people) realise that it leads to loss. That is, ‘let everyone realise that this will lead to destruction’. 
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 21 — ‘ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ’ - ‘en to logo touto’ - ‘in this word’. That is, in the intention to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit - the desire to receive God&#39;s gift is not evil, but the intention to receive it in exchange for money is a serious sin. ‘Word’ here means ‘meaning’ and ‘intention’.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 22 — ‘μετανόησον οὖν ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας σου ταύτης’ - ‘metanoeson oun apo tes kakias sou tautes’ - ‘repent (change your mind), therefore, from this your evil’. That is, change your thoughts and attitudes, intentions, vision, so that the Lord would accept a new vision. At the same time, the apostle Peter does not expect Simon to fully convert and repent because he has just sinned gravely, but this is not impossible. Serious sin often hinders conversion, but it does not exclude its possibility.
</p>
<p>
Acts VIII, 25 — ‘εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα’ - ‘eis Hierosolyma’ - ‘into Jerusalem; to Jerusalem’. Where to.

<reading>(John VI, 35-39) </reading><br>
John VI, 35 — ‘ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ’ - ‘ho pisteuon eis eme’ - ‘whoever believes into Me’. These are polysemous words that indicate that true faith leads to Christ, likens a person to Christ, that is, its goal and destination, its fulfilment, is Christ Himself. See more at the following links:<br>

John VI, 38 — ‘ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ’ - ‘apo tou ouranou’ - ‘from the heaven’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that the Son of God humbled Himself in the Incarnation - instead of the glory that was due to Him, He descended on the cross, even to Hades to save people. 
</p>
<p>
John VI, 39 — ‘ἵνα πᾶν ὃ δέδωκέν μοι μὴ ἀπολέσω ἐξ αὐτοῦ’ - ‘hina pan ho dedoken moi me apoleso ex autou’ - ‘so that all that He has given Me I may not lose from (of) them’. That is, so that Christ may save people and not perish them. Christ came to save people, not to perish them. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that it is a reference to what the Father gave to Christ, to what is in this group. We need to understand that it is not just people who are meant here. For example, the Father gave the Son the Law (not as a restriction, but as something that is given into authority, transmitted into full control and possession), and Christ did not throw away or destroy anything from the Law, but fulfilled the Law.
