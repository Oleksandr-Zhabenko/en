<p><reading>(Acts II, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts II, 3  &ndash; <q>tongues of fire</q>  &ndash; literally <q>tongues
like fire</q>.</p>
<p>Acts II, 4  &ndash; <q>with tongues</q>  &ndash; the same polysemous word (â€˜Î³Î»Ï‰ÏƒÏƒÎ±â€™) as
â€˜tonguesâ€™ above. Here we have a kind of resemblance to a <q>play on
words</q>.</p>
<p>Acts II, 6  &ndash; â€˜ÏƒÏ…Î½Î·Î»Î¸ÎµÎ½ Ï„Î¿ Ï€Î»Î·Î¸Î¿Ï‚ ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÏƒÏ…Î½ÎµÏ‡Ï…Î¸Î·â€™  &ndash; â€˜synulthen to
plethos kai synechytheâ€™  &ndash; literally a polysemous expression <q>the crowds
came together and poured together / were confounded / were confused</q>
(the last word has two different meanings, all of which are appropriate
here in their own way)  &ndash; that is, different peoples came together,
â€˜poured togetherâ€™, and at the same time were in a state of confusion, in
an unusual state of focused and engaged attention and mind. The word for
<q>language</q> here is already â€˜Î´Î¹Î±Î»ÎµÎºÏ„Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜dialektoâ€™  &ndash; from which we get
the word <q>dialect</q>.</p>
<p>Acts II, 8 is literally <q>the language of us in which we were born</q>.
People are <q>born in a particular language</q> according to these words. It
can be understood that in the womb children hear the language of their
environment, the language of their parents, and are born <q>in it</q>, <q>in
the language</q>.</p>
<p>Acts II, 11  &ndash; again the word <q>tongues</q> is used  &ndash; â€˜Î³Î»Î¿ÏƒÏƒÎ±Î¹Ï‚â€™.</p>

<p><reading>(John VII, 37-52; VIII, 12) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VII, 38  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™  &ndash; (in) â€˜Meâ€™.
â€˜ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î»Î¹Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜koiliasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜bellyâ€™.</p>
<p>John VII, 39  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ»Î»Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emellonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜intended, were about toâ€™ -
from â€˜Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜melloâ€™.</p>
<p>The reading also mentions Nicodemus, one of my beloved saints, who
had a conversation with Jesus. He tried to defend Jesus among the
Pharisees to whom he belonged.</p>
<p>John VIII, 12  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. Used for emphasis. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹â€™
- â€˜emoiâ€™  &ndash; (by) <q>Me</q>. There is a good article about the light of life at
the following link:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="09042023.html">09042023.html</a></p>
<p>The reading is devoted to the theme of the Holy Spirit and faith in
Christ.</p>
<p>John VII, 39 clearly shows that the glorification of Jesus is the way
to the coming of the Holy Spirit. I have written about this before: <q>In
as many ways as you can glorify Jesus Christ, in as many ways can the
Holy Spirit work in you.</q> See

<p>About the Holy Trinity, whose solemnity is celebrated today, there is
a good article here:
