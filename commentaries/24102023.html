<p><reading>(Colossians I, 1-2, 7-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>The beginning of the readings from the
Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Colossians. It is similar in subject
matter to the Epistle to the Ephesians, so it is often thought that they
were written at about the same time. Moreover, Colossae and Ephesus were
geographically quite close to each other. It is believed that the
occasion for the writing was a certain heresy that began to spread among
the Colossians (see, for example:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="http://www.cpbi.info/library/1/21/">http://www.cpbi.info/library/1/21/</a><br>
).</p>
<p>Colossians I, 2, 7  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>Colossians I, 7  &ndash; ‘εμαθετε’  &ndash; ‘emathete’  &ndash; ‘learned’  &ndash; ‘μανθανω’ -
‘manthano’  &ndash; ‘to learn’.</p>
<p>Colossians I, 8  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>Colossians I, 9  &ndash; ‘ημειας’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’. ‘ημερας’  &ndash; ‘emeras’ -
(of the) ‘day’.</p>
<p>The letter begins with greetings and wishes.</p>
<p>Then the immediate occasion of the letter is mentioned  &ndash; the
narration of Epaphras, Paul’s co-worker, one of the 70 apostles.</p>
<p>The purpose of the letter is then stated: that the Colossians might
be strengthened in the faith and live spiritually according to the grace
of God.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of endurance and longsuffering, which are built on hope,
and of growth in the knowledge of God. All of these things should serve
to ensure that the Colossians live holy lives, so that the King of their
lives is truly Christ, Whose glory is to come.</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of longsuffering, he does not mean that one should
suffer for a long time for the sake of faith, but rather that one should
be enduring in goodness, not faint or complain, but grow in love and
knowledge of God’s will. In other words, to be long-suffering, one must
always keep hope, as well as love and faith (keep and remember hope, be
inspired by it, have faith and grow in love).</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XI, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke XI, 1, 4  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>Luke XI, 3, 4  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our). ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘us’
(ours). ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; ‘day’ (daily).</p>
<p>Luke XI, 7  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘me’ ((with) me).</p>
<p>About prayer, in particular the Lord’s Prayer. Luke’s version differs
from Matthew’s, and some manuscripts are missing some of the words. For
parallel passages to the readings, see the references and others cited
there: <br>

<p>Only Luke has the part about insistence, but it is quite eloquent in
the light of the above references. I would note that there was still a
certain relationship (friendship) between the host and the beggar, but
the words emphasise that it may be far from ideal, but one should still
ask.</p>
