<p>(2 Corinthians IV:1-6) 2 Corinthians IV, 3, 6  - endash ‘ημων’  - endash ‘emon’ -
‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians IV, 4  - endash ‘εικων’  - endash ‘eikon’  - endash ‘image’ (hence the word
‘icon’).</p>
<p>The beginning of the reading is about the motivation of the apostles
(at least a significant and meaningful part of it) in their work. Here,
Paul implicitly gives a recipe for how preachers of the Gospel and
Christ can avoid burnout, how they can keep their desire and inspiration
alive, and how they can keep their motivation to work.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>The first is the memory of God’s mercy, manifested in what one
preaches.</p>
<p>It goes on to describe what hinders, what <q>takes away strength</q> -
<q>secret shame</q> (i.e., if the teaching is false, there is insincerity,
falsehood), <q>cunning</q> (i.e., attempts to build a sermon on purely human
foundations, including cunning, psychological tricks, bait, etc.),
<q>distortion of God’s Word</q> (i.e., a distorted presentation of what was
received from God), and an important component for the power of
preaching  - endash <q>by the manifestation of the truth we entrust ourselves to
every human conscience before God</q>  - endash preaching requires the preacher’s
trust in the listeners. It requires sincerity, openness, truthfulness,
authenticity, honesty, impartiality, i.e. openness to all people,
respect for human dignity, it must touch the conscience,
i.e. understanding of good and evil, in particular at the level of
feelings, and it must be carried out <q>before God</q>  - endash as if preaching to
God Himself about Himself and about people. Yes, a person preaches to
people about God, but he or she should also think in the opposite
direction  - endash preaching as if preaching to God about Him and about people.
This last point points most of all to the divinity of preaching.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but without the latter component, a preaching
can be more or less like various other activities  - endash for example, a
speech by a hero or an award winner. It can be likened to a conversation
between deeply loving and close people. It can be likened to a moral,
deeply conscious choice.</p>
<p>But the preaching should ideally be the same as when one preaches to
God about Himself and about people (and this is its most important
difference from all the above and similar).</p>
<p>I will also cite the following argument from psychology. It is known
that new information is best absorbed when a person teaches it to
someone else and explains it to someone else. This is the best possible
way to learn something well. One might think that in this case one could
explain something to… God. Yes, God knows everything, He doesn’t need
our explanations, but try explaining to God, Who knows everything, what
you are learning, if it is good (with all the significance and
seriousness).</p>
<p>Paul goes on to say that there is no <q>secret knowledge</q> or <q>secret
doctrine</q> in Christianity, it is open, but people can be hindered by
attachment to sins, which is called <q>the god of this age</q>.</p>
<p>Paul mentions ministry, which I wrote more about here:

<p>Paul also testifies to the light of God’s grace in the hearts of the
faithful, which (the grace) enables them to know God in Christ, through
Christ.</p>

<p>(Matthew XXIV, 13-28) Matthew XXIV:19  - endash ‘γαστρι’  - endash ‘gastri’  - endash ‘womb,
stomach’. ‘ημεραις’  - endash ‘emerais’  - endash ‘days’.</p>
<p>Matthew XXIV, 22  - endash ‘ημεραι’  - endash ‘emerai’  - endash ‘days’.</p>
