it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

At Matins: composite Apostle:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians V, 6-8; Galatians III, 13-14; Matthew XXVII, 62-66) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians V, 8 — 'μὴ ἐν ζύμῃ παλαιᾷ μηδὲ ἐν ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας, ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀζύμοις εἰλικρινίας καὶ ἀληθείας' - 'me en zyme palaia mede en zyme kakias kai ponerias, all en azymois eilikrinias kai aletheias' - <q>not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</q> People are likened to bread (initially flour for bread), and their life depends on what brings change, what moves forward, what motivates, what gives life. And this should be purity (from sins, passions, and vices) and truth as gifts of grace.   
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 13 — 'Χριστὸς ἡμᾶς ἐξηγόρασεν ἐκ τῆς κατάρας τοῦ νόμου' - 'CHristos hemas exegorasen ek tes kataras tou nomou' - <q>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law.</q> That is, Christ has redeemed us from the just punishment according to God's Law. See more about this specifically at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
III, 14 — 'ἵνα εἰς τὰ ἔθνη ἡ εὐλογία τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ γένηται ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ' - 'hina eis ta ethne he eulogia tou Abraam genetai en CHristo Iesou' - <q>so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the nations in Jesus Christ; so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Jesus Christ.</q> Different translation options are possible. The preposition 'eis' here indicates that it concerns both the purpose - a blessing for all nations for their salvation, and movement and spread. Christ is the Blessing of Abraham.

Matthew XXVIII, 1 — 'τῇ ἐπιφωσκούσῃ εἰς μίαν σαββάτων,' - 'te epiphoskouse eis mian sabbaton' - <q>as it began to dawn on the first day after the sabbath.</q> The preposition 'eis' here indicates the approach of sunrise, dawn.

<p>
Matthew XXVIII, 2 — 'ἄγγελος γὰρ κυρίου καταβὰς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ' - 'angelos gar kyriou katabas ex ouranou' - <q>for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven.</q> The preposition 'ek' in its form before the following vowel here indicates from where he descended or from where the angel himself is (possibly both meanings).
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXVIII, 4 — 'ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ φόβου αὐτοῦ' - 'apo de tou phobou autou' - <q>And from fear of him.</q> The preposition 'apo' here indicates that the angel did not try to frighten the guard, did not threaten them, did not attack, the guard's fear was caused solely by the great glory of this messenger of God, the holy angel.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXVIII, 7 — 'ὅτι ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν' - 'oti egerthe apo ton nekron' - <q>that He has risen from the dead.</q> The preposition 'apo' here indicates that Christ is no longer dead any more - His body is not here as dead, because He has risen, completely left Hades and freed the faithful. 'προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν' - 'proagei hymas eis ten Galilaian' - <q>He is going before you into Galilee.</q> The preposition 'eis' here indicates the direction of movement.

<p>
Matthew XXVIII, 8 — 'ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου μετὰ φόβου καὶ χαρᾶς μεγάλης' - 'apo tou mnemeiou meta phobou kai kharas megales' - <q>from the tomb with fear and great joy.</q> A state similar to the feelings of the apostles during the Transfiguration on the mountain. It indicates the spirituality of the experience. See more at the links:<br>

Matthew XXVIII, 19 — 'βαπτίζοντες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος' - 'baptizontes autous eis to onoma tou patros kai tou hyiou kai tou hagiou pneumatos' - <q>baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</q> The original formula of the Sacrament of Baptism.
