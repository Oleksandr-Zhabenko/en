<p><reading>(Acts 16:16-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts XVI, 26  &ndash; â€˜Î¸ÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ»Î¹Î±â€™  &ndash; â€˜themeliaâ€™ -
â€˜foundationsâ€™.</p>
<p>Acts XVI, 27  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»ÎµÎ½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emellenâ€™  &ndash; â€˜was about to, was close toâ€™ -
from â€˜Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜melloâ€™.</p>
<p>Read about the events that preceded those described in the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="20052023.html">20052023.html</a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that starting a little earlier in chapter XVI, the
book of Acts uses the word <q>we</q>, meaning that the apostle and evangelist
Luke, my beloved saint, joined Paul and Silas.</p>
<p>The story is about the healing of the young soothsayer and the
imprisonment of Paul and Silas, as well as the miraculous conversion of
the jailer and his whole household. The events in the prison take place
at night, quickly, and we can see how responsible the jailer was, but
his desire to commit suicide shows that responsibility can lead a person
to evil if he or she does not have the right attitude, the right
faith.</p>
<p>Regarding the soothsayer, the fact that the apostles allowed her to
prophesy shows that they were not spiritual <q>conquerors</q>, but where the
Lord gave them the power, they delivered people from the power of evil,
and this happened in the events described in this reading.</p>

<p><reading>(John IX, 1-38) </reading>
</p>
<p>John IX, 5, 9  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is
used for emphasis.</p>
<p>The story of the healing of a blind man from birth. It has many
important points. In general, we can see a kind of movement, a
<q>spreading</q> of the Gospel from the closest disciples of Jesus (closer to
the Easter holiday) and up to people who come to know Jesus not
immediately but gradually, including the healed man born blind.</p>
<p>We see Godâ€™s permission for the man to be born blind, but also Godâ€™s
will to heal him and bring him to the cognition of the truth. Let me
emphasise that Jesus does not say that God made him blind from birth,
but that it was God who healed him. This emphasises that the blindness
was an allowance of God, something that God did not want, but
providentially permitted and now healed.</p>
<p>The dialogues with the Jews show their hardening of their unbelief,
fear of manâ€™s parents, but also the openness of the healed blind man to
the truth. The readings are available here:

clarify the situation better.</p>
<p>To the Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian: (1 John I, 1-7)
There are good readings on light and life at the following links:

<br><a class="link2" href="15042023.html">15042023.html</a></p>
<p><q>The blood of Jesus Christ</q> refers to both the Sacrifice of Jesus and
the Sacrament of Communion, the Eucharist.</p>
<p><q>Communion</q> is a polysemous word â€˜ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½Î¹Î±â€™, which means both
<q>community, fellowship, sharing and participating</q> and can also mean
<q>communion</q>. See more:

<p><reading>(John XIX, 25-27; XXI, 24-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>The readings where the Apostle John the
Theologian stands with the Mother of God beside the Crucified Saviour,
and Christ actually adopts John to the Mother of God (which is a great
honour), as well as the fact that it was John the Theologian who wrote
the fourth Gospel, also show that the actions of God are inexhaustible
in depth. Therefore, it is wrong to think that everything has been
written and said in theology.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
