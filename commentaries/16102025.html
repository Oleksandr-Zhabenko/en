And when Paul is in difficult circumstances, when he may die, then this also brings him closer to the reward in Christ, to eternal life, and also — in contrast to people far from God, from Christ — the fact that death does not distance from Christ, but gives the possibility also to be united with Him, this is an advantage, value, gain, acquisition.

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Philippians I, 20-27) </reading><br>
Philippians I, 20 — &#39;ἐν οὐδενὶ αἰσχυνθήσομαι, ἀλλ&#39; ἐν πάσῃ παρρησίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en oudeni aiskhynthesomai all en pase parresia&#39; - <q>in nothing, but in all boldness; in nothing, but in full confidence</q>. Different translation variants are possible through the multivalence of the word <q>parresia</q>. &#39;ἐν τῷ σώματί μου&#39; - &#39;en to somati mou&#39; - <q>in my body</q>. Here it is spoken of a person&#39;s ministry in the body — and the apostle expresses faith that his devotion to Christ and persistent labour will lead to the glorification of Christ in all his life.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 21 — &#39;το ζην χριστος και το αποθανειν κερδος&#39; - &#39;to zen CHristos kai to apothanein kerdos&#39; - literally <q>life — Christ and dying (state close to death, approach to death) — gain (acquisition, advantage)</q>. Here is a well-known and deep passage, I will focus on it in a bit more detail. The Apostle Paul means that he lives for Christ, trying to please Christ Himself, therefore he can call his life <q>Christ</q> in the sense that the meaning and centre, content of his life is Christ Himself (and this is great happiness). And when Paul is in difficult circumstances, when he may die, then this also brings him closer to the reward in Christ, to eternal life, and also — in contrast to people far from God, from Christ — the fact that death does not distance from Christ, but gives the possibility also to be united with Him, this is an advantage, value, gain, acquisition. About which Paul writes more here further.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 22 — &#39;τὸ ζῆν ἐν σαρκί&#39; - &#39;to zen en sarki&#39; - <q>life in the flesh</q>. That is, present life with its weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 23 — &#39;ἐκ τῶν δύο&#39; - &#39;ek ton duo&#39; - <q>from those two</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here the source of action. &#39;εἰς τὸ ἀναλῦσαι&#39; - &#39;eis to analysai&#39; - <q>to depart; that I may depart</q> (here figuratively — to die).
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 25 — &#39;εἰς τὴν ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;eis ten hymon&#39; - <q>for you; to you</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates movement towards, and by meaning also direction, address.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 26 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; - <q>in Christ Jesus; with Christ Jesus</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first emphasises the general connection of joy with Christ, and the second indicates that Christ is the Cause and Source of joy. &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - &#39;en emoi&#39; - <q>in me</q>. By meaning also <q>through me</q>.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 27 — &#39;ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι&#39; - &#39;en heni pneumati&#39; - <q>in one Spirit</q>. Indicates the Holy Spirit, Who both unites and gives strength.
</p>
<p>
Paul himself here does not decide what is better for him, but he realises that both are good. And what will be fulfilled is that he will continue to live, and has at least the intention to come later to the Philippians. Judging by everything, Paul is confident, for he received some assurance from God (about his life), perhaps a revelation about it, or perhaps some events clearly indicate God&#39;s deliverance from dangers.
</p>
<p>
And further he says that he wants to praise the Philippians, and also that his praise, and also his life and coming, the fulfilment of God&#39;s assurance, will be for the Philippians even greater praise and joy.
</p>
<p>
Today&#39;s reading concludes with encouragement and exhortation to live according to and defend the faith of Christ, the Gospel.

<p>
<reading>(Luke VI, 12-19) </reading><br>
Luke VI, 12 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις&#39; - &#39;en tais hemerais&#39; - <q>in those days</q>. Common expression. &#39;εἰς τὸ ὄρος&#39; - &#39;eis to oros&#39; - <q>to the mountain; onto the mountain</q>. Where to. &#39;ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ&#39; - &#39;en te proseukhe&#39; - <q>in high, inspired prayer</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 13 — &#39;ἀπ&#39; αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;ap auton&#39; - <q>from them</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that Jesus separated the twelve from all others.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 17 — &#39;ἀπὸ πάσης&#39; - &#39;apo pases&#39; - <q>from all</q>. &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν νόσων&#39; - &#39;apo ton noson&#39; - <q>from diseases</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that people left completely the regions, also completely got rid of their diseases, complete total healing. The very word <q>healing</q> has a root from the word <q>whole</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 18 — &#39;ἀπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων&#39; - &#39;apo pneumaton akatharton&#39; - <q>from unclean spirits</q>. See just above.
</p>
<p>
Luke VI, 19 — &#39;παρ&#39; αὐτοῦ&#39; - &#39;par autou&#39; - <q>from beside Him</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here is with genitive case. Such a construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father in the Godhead. I already wrote earlier that this parallel is essential and mysterious — here it emphasises the fullness of the Holy Spirit in Christ according to His human nature — through His human nature people received God&#39;s gifts and healing. He truly is the promised Anointed One, Messiah, Christ. See also at the link:<br>
