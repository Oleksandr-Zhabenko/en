it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Philippians I, 8-14) </reading><br>
Philippians I, 8 — &#39;ἐν σπλάγχνοις&#39; - &#39;en splankhnois&#39; - <q>in the inner parts; in the heart; inside; with inner parts</q>. All translation variants are possible, since deep feelings are meant.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 9 — &#39;ἐν ἐπιγνώσει καὶ πάσῃ αἰσθήσει&#39; - &#39;en epignosei kai pase aisthesei&#39; - <q>in cognition and all perception; with cognition and all perception</q>. Both translation variants are possible. The first indicates cognition as that against which love develops well, and the second — that true knowledge of God, of Christ leads, brings, causes to love.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 10 — &#39;εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν&#39; - &#39;eis to dokimazein&#39; - <q>that you may experience; that you may approve after testing</q>. Somewhat multivalent words, which nevertheless are completely understandable from context. &#39;εἰς ἡμέραν Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis hemeran CHristou&#39; - <q>for the day of Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates readiness to stand before Christ in His glory.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 11 — &#39;εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis doxan kai epainon theou&#39; - <q>unto the glory and praise of God; for the glory and praise of God</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the purpose. More about glory and praise in the Biblical understanding see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Beauty.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Beauty.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 12 — &#39;εἰς προκοπὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου&#39; - &#39;eis prokopen tou euangeliou&#39; - <q>for the successful development of the gospel; for the progress of the Gospel</q>. Here also the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose. It is spoken of spreading, acceptance of the Gospel for salvation and sanctification of people.
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 13 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>. &#39;ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ πραιτωρίῳ&#39; - &#39;en holo to praitorio&#39; - <q>in the whole praetorium</q> (that is, palace in Jerusalem, captured by the Romans, or in the quarters of the praetorians, Roman guards, in Rome).
</p>
<p>
Philippians I, 14 — &#39;ἐν κυρίῳ&#39; - &#39;en kyrio&#39; - <q>in the Lord</q>. It is spoken of <q>brothers in the Lord</q>. &#39;περισσοτερως τολμαν αφοβως&#39; - &#39;perissoteros tolman aphobos&#39; - <q>excessively (extraordinarily, surpassingly) boldly (courageously and) fearlessly</q>. These words testify about several things:<br>
1) Paul did not expect such inspiration for preaching among the faithful through his imprisonment for Christ;<br>
2) Paul could think about a more moderate way of preaching for the faithful, but they on the contrary showed zeal and boldness.
</p>
<p>
One can say from the entire description (today&#39;s and following), that in one word (two): the preaching was <q>fervent, passionate</q>.
</p>
<p>
The example of boldness and courage of Paul himself as an apostle inspired others to similar efforts, and especially the situation with Paul&#39;s imprisonment. About which he writes. In the history of the Church there were many such cases, particularly very often such mentions are in descriptions of sufferings of holy martyrs for Christ.
</p>
<p>
Also here is an important lesson for all — one needs to preach with faith, also boldly, but also wisdom, about which Paul speaks implicitly, — one needs to show reason in everything.
