<p><reading>(Philippians IV, 10-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>This reading is preceded by the one I wrote
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="09042023.html">09042023.html</a></p>
<p>This reading concludes the Epistle to the Philippians.</p>
<p>Philippians IV, 10  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; â€˜meâ€™.</p>
<p>Philippians IV, 11  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¸Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emathonâ€™  &ndash; <q>learned</q>  &ndash; from
â€˜Î¼Î±Î½Î¹Î±Î½Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜manthanoâ€™  &ndash; â€˜to learnâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is
used for emphasis.</p>
<p>Philippians IV:20  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™ (our).</p>
<p>Philippians IV:21  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜emoiâ€™  &ndash; â€˜meâ€™ ((with) me).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul writes in a few sentences that the Philippians were
the only church in Macedonia to send him gifts to support his mission,
that he is grateful to them and prays for Godâ€™s blessing on them. At the
same time, Paul writes that he rejoices not in the gifts he has
received, but in the fact that this offering of the Philippians is their
glory in Christ. Paul himself says that he can live and continue his
mission without this valuable help, because as an apostle in Christ he
is accustomed to living in various conditions, favourable or
unfavourable, thanking God for what He provides through Paulâ€™s work and
the help of people, but rejoicing in this Gospel participation in
Christâ€™s work for the salvation of people and the cognition of the
truth.</p>
<p>The words of verse 13 (with an addition that is not in all
manuscripts, but is obvious) are very famous.</p>
<p>I note that Paul is not afraid to praise the Philippians for their
special charity to the glory of God, but he does not make it a special
merit. It is good to glorify God, but it can be dangerous to see this
glorification as merit because of the temptation of arrogance.</p>
<p>There is also a lesson here about being satisfied with what God
gives. It is often thought that being satisfied with what we have means
not striving for more, not striving for growth and development. This is
a misunderstanding. Satisfaction means that there is no internal (or
also external) protest that <q>this is not enough!</q>, <q>this is not enough
for me!</q>, etc., but it is open to receiving more and moving forward and
upwards. <q>Itâ€™s good what we have, AND we will move on!</q>. Without
satisfaction in this sense, happiness is impossible; it is itself to
some extent happiness. We also need to remember that God is in this
sense All-Satisfied, the Holy Trinity has no need for anything outside
of Themselves.</p>
<p>The letter concludes with greetings and blessings and a wish for
grace in the Lord.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke X, 22-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>The first part of the reading is well written about
in relation to the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XI, 25-27), see

<p>The second part of the reading is also discussed in the parallel
passage in Matthew (Matthew XIII, 16), which is referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="10072023.html">10072023.html</a></p>
<p>To the apostle James, the Lordâ€™s brother by the flesh: (Galatians I,
