<p>(Acts XXV, 13-19) The witness of a Gentile, a ruler and a judge about
Paul and the accusations against him and the Christians. It is important
in the sense that it shows the legal groundlessness of the persecution
of Christians, which was taking place at that time and in later times as
well. The words of the ruler also show what Christians expected from the
authorities at the time when they were put on judgement  - endash the
opportunity to defend themselves in court and for the court to be
impartial towards them. Unfortunately, this desire of Christians was
often not fulfilled. But in this case (with Paul) it was fulfilled, and
Luke writes about it.</p>

<p>(John XVI, 23-33) John XVI, 23, 27  - endash ‘εμε’  - endash ‘eme’  - endash ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John XVI, 25, 29  - endash ‘παρρησια’ and ‘παροιμιαις’  - endash ‘parresia’ and
‘paroimiais’  - endash contrasts ‘openness, freedom, all-outspokenness,
frankness’ with ‘closed, dark, obscure, mysterious and allegorical
language, the language of parables’. The former takes precedence, just
as the explicit takes precedence over the hidden in God, because
everything is clear to God. Moreover, it sheds light on how God is the
Omniscient  - endash He is Free and Open to know everything, His freedom and
openness are not limited by secrets or any obstacles.</p>
<p>John XVI, 27  - endash ‘φιλει’  - endash ‘philei’  - endash ‘loves’. This love is mostly
similar to friendship and family and is based on closeness, intimacy and
trust. In modern language, it has many different meanings, but in
Scripture it is this one.</p>
<p>John XVI, 32  - endash ‘ειμι’  - endash ‘eimi’  - endash (I) ‘am’. It is used for emphasis.
‘εμου’  - endash ‘emou’  - endash (by) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>John XVI, 33  - endash ‘εμοι’  - endash ‘emoi’  - endash (to) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s and the previous readings from Jesus’
conversation with the disciples at the Last Supper. See yesterday’s
reading here:
<br><a class="link2" href="31052023.html">31052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>God’s intention in the Suffering, Death, Resurrection and Ascension
of Jesus Christ becomes clear, but the disciples at the Last Supper only
understood that Christ was <q>going to the Father</q> in one way or
another.</p>
<p>To Saints Co-apostlolic Constantine and Helen (moved from 3 June):
(Acts XXVI, 1-5, 12-20; John X, 1-9) Acts XXVI, 2  - endash ‘εμαυτον’ -
‘emauton’  - endash ‘myself’. See above on the first reading.</p>
<p>Acts XXVI, 5  - endash ‘αιρεσιν’  - endash ‘hairesin’  - endash ‘religious party, sect,
convinced opinion’, from which the word ‘heresy’ is derived. Literally,
<q>in the most demanding party of our religion (ritualism, piety)</q>.</p>
<p>Acts XXVI, 13  - endash ‘εμοι’  - endash ‘emoi’  - endash (with) ‘me’.</p>
<p>Acts XXVI, 15  - endash ‘ειμι’  - endash ‘eimi’  - endash (I) ‘am’. Used with emphasis.</p>
<p>Acts XXVI, 18  - endash ‘εμε’  - endash ‘eme’  - endash (to) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>The manifestation of Jesus to Paul (Saul) on the road to Damascus was
analysed in the reading of the parallel passage in the book of Acts. See
the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="05052023.html">05052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Here a parallel is drawn between the once gentile Emperor Constantine
and Paul, since the former also converted after the miraculous heavenly
manifestation of the Cross of the Lord. His significance for the Church
is also very great.</p>
<p>The readings from the Gospel are frequent, see the link:
