<p>Quote:</p>
<p><q>The Lord Jesus Christ said:</q>Judge not, and you shall not be judged.
Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be
forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down,
shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with
the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.” (Luke
VI, 37-38). Let’s think about how often we measure. We say or even
think, perhaps without even realising it, that the house is big and
spacious, and we measure it by the standards of size and the ability to
move around and see. What is the problem? Our measures are rarely truly
accurate, which is evident from the fact that we can measure in
completely different ways, arbitrarily. A good measure means one that is
correct, i.e. just as a kilogram weight should be 1 kg, so it is  &ndash; the
situation described here is correct, and it is the way God created it.
Pressed down and shaken heterogeneous mixtures or raw materials so that
they are more homogeneous, the same in different directions, points to
that fact of mutual measurement will not happen immediately, but after
many attempts to measure, and it will be more or less correct
statistically. Running over means that the response will be more
significant and perhaps more intense than the action itself, the measure
itself. The bosom of a garment is the part of the garment that is not
usually flaunted, which is somewhere on the periphery of attention and
consciousness. And very often we measure ourselves, as well as other
people’s measurements, at the bosom, limiting ourselves. This response
is often implicit if you don’t pay attention to it, just as division is
often overlooked.” That is why it is very important to be careful,
accurate and precise when measuring.</p>

<p>About pure and impure  &ndash; Paul means here that it is the conscience
that makes food <q>impure</q> (in the sense of the ritual Law of Moses) for a
person. In other words, if the person is tempted by the food, it is ”
impure” in the sense that he or she must be careful about it so as not
to fall into sin (just as one had to be careful about what was <q>impure</q>
in terms of the Law of Moses). But this does not mean that the food is
really impure, that it carries with it some kind of defilement.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XII, 14-16, 22-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XII, 26  &ndash; ‘εμερισθη’ -
‘emeristhe’  &ndash; ‘divided into parts’  &ndash; from ‘μεριζω’  &ndash; ‘merizo’  &ndash; ‘to
divide into parts’.</p>
<p>Matthew XII, 30  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘Me, by Me’.</p>
<p>I wrote earlier, and I will quote:</p>
<p><q>To defeat an external challenge, we need internal unity. After all,
an external threat comes to an internal territory, and if the latter has
forces that are directed against each other, forces that are
approximately equal, comparable, then external challenges will be able
to overcome resistance. Otherwise, the external threat on the internal
territory will not have enough strength to win. This is a very important
thought for Ukraine and Europe at this time.</p>
<p>There is a good explanation of verse 30 here:

(Matthew is clear here: <q>whoever is not with Me is against Me,</q> with no
other possible options for understanding).</p>
<p>To the martyrs: (Ephesians VI, 10-17; Luke XXI, 5-7, 10-11, 20-24)

<p>Luke XXI, 23  &ndash; ‘γαστρι’  &ndash; ‘gastri’  &ndash; <q>stomach; also can be womb,
belly (as in this case)</q>.</p>
<p>The Gospel reading is about the approaching end of the world and the
fall of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The parallel passage in Matthew is told about here:
