<p><reading>(Colossians II, 13-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>Colossians II:13, 14  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Î¹Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜eminâ€™ -
â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>Colossians II, 14  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>Colossians II, 18  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î²Î±Ï„ÎµÏ…Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜embateuonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜standing on,
entering into, intruding uponâ€™.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul is denouncing a heresy that was beginning to spread
among the Colossians. Nevertheless, he does this in general terms, which
is why it is not clear what the heresy actually consisted of.</p>
<p>Paul says that the heresy spread an excessive belief in the powers of
angels, taught them to serve them in some way, and thus exalted the
creation above the Creator, Christ. Therefore, Paul here shows that
Christ is higher than the angels. Earlier he testified that Christ is
the Son of God, the image of the Father, the Head of the Church. It is
Christ Who is at the centre of Revelation, and therefore of the
preaching of the apostles and the life of the faithful.</p>
<p>Paul also points out one of the main reasons why this heresy arose,
and why many others arise, is because of <q>the puffing up of the mind</q>,
or, simply put, because of arrogance. Many scholars and researchers
believe that this heresy was similar to later Gnosticism, perhaps one of
the first known (documented) varieties of it.</p>
<p>The specific verses of the reading remain unclear, to a certain
extent mysterious as to what is specifically meant.</p>
<p><q>â€˜Principalities and authoritiesâ€™ are angelic ranks, some of whose
representatives became demons. It was these demons who were put to shame
by the suffering on the cross of the Crucified Son of God, Who humbled
Himself in contrast to those demons.</p>
<p>Paul also speaks again of the Mosaic Law as well as of Gentile
beliefs, for the Gentiles also celebrated the new moon.</p>
<p>That is why Paul again and again refers to Christ, in whom <q>all the
treasures of wisdom are hidden</q>.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XI, 29-33) </reading>

<p>For a parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XII,
38-42, Matthew has a more detailed account of this passage), see
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02LcLj31wQv4uMwn1DWHmQoXrSW7V8AKHuo6b3zPSugxHxjUf17YW2cNPPs7hKwKdkl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>Why it is wrong to build faith only on something extraordinary, I
have written several times before, in particular at the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid037PTz5Reidgd9tXcEpPyqd3k73kBwuMVcEFCZHm3g4FmNH9RF5AcWSz3xCunhGGK1l">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>There are different opinions about how Gentiles and non-Christians
can judge the <q>evil generation</q>, often thinking that they will show by
their own example that people could have shown love and did not, that
they could have shown faith and did not want to, and so on. In other
words, they will not be <q>plaintiffs</q> against the <q>evil generation</q>, but
<q>witnesses</q> to the fact that they could have been quite different.</p>
<p>It is also important that the Lord will judge people by their
openness to Godâ€™s will, including the Gentiles. And in this openness, in
this search, many Gentiles can serve as an example for the <q>evil
generation</q>.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
