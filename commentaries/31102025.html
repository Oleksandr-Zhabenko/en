it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Colossians II, 1-7) </reading><br>
Colossians II, 1 – &#39;τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ&#39; – &#39;ton en Laodikia&#39; – <q>those in Laodicea</q>. Where. &#39;τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν σαρκί&#39; – &#39;to prosopon mou en sarki&#39; – <q>my face in the flesh</q>. That is, who had not seen Paul bodily. The use of <q>flesh</q> here may indicate Paul&#39;s age, that is, it points to bodily weakness, which may have been due to his age. See also:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/13112024.html ">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/13112024.html </a><br>
One may think that the apostle has in mind his bodily infirmities. <q>I struggle for you in weaknesses, and I struggle also for those who have never seen me</q>, – one may emphasise this nuance.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 2 – &#39;ἐν ἀγάπῃ&#39; – &#39;en agape&#39; – <q>in love; with love</q>. Both translation variants are possible, where the first emphasises that love encompasses other virtues, whilst the second emphasises that it itself, as <q>the bond of perfection</q> (that which unites, a binding link), also unites people. &#39;εἰς πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως&#39; – &#39;eis pan ploutos tes plerophorias tes syneseos&#39; – <q>for all the riches of full understanding</q>. Very eloquent, elevated words. &#39;εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν&#39; – &#39;eis epignosin&#39; – <q>for cognition</q>. In both cases here, the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 3 – &#39;ἐν ᾧ&#39; – &#39;en ho&#39; – <q>in Whom; with Whom</q>. The first variant has the advantage, because it emphasises that, in knowing Christ, one discovers the treasures of wisdom, whilst the second presupposes that the Father concealed these treasures of knowledge through Christ, which raises additional questions, since in fact Christ precisely revealed and made known to people both the Father and Himself.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 4 — &#39;ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en pithanologia&#39; - <q>in persuasive words; with persuasive words</q>. Both translation variants are possible. The first variant indicates that significance is given to these false deceptive words by cunning people (perhaps even they are sincerely convinced of their correctness), and the second — that they on the contrary — simply cynically use them for deception as a means.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 5 — &#39;τὸ στερέωμα τῆς εἰς Χριστὸν πίστεως ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;to stereoma tes eis CHriston pisteos hymon&#39; - <q>the firmness of your faith in Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; emphasises that faith in Christ also is and is to be movement towards Him, He is the Goal and Final Point of movement. A typical preposition for faith in Christ, similarly used in other places of the New Testament.
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 6, 7 — &#39;ἐν αὐτῷ&#39; - &#39;en auto&#39; - <q>in Him; with Him</q>. Both translation variants are possible, although the first is simpler for understanding, and the second has parallels with Acts XVII, 28. See at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/03102025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/03102025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Colossians II, 7 — &#39;ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ&#39; - &#39;en eukharistia&#39; - <q>in thanksgiving; with thanksgiving</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first emphasises that thanksgiving often includes other virtues, and the second — that thanksgiving itself is wealth and capable of overflowing a person with joy.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul says that although he is absent bodily, he supports the faith of the Colossians, also the Laodiceans, particularly also those who have never personally seen him.
</p>
<p>
Important is that in Christ are hidden all treasures of wisdom. This means that all wisdom, everything that cannot be easily obtained from experience or simple knowledge, everything important and essential needs to be sought in Christ. And that which lies on the surface, which is easy to see and obvious, a person can see and know by virtue of her natural abilities. This latter also happens with Christ&#39;s participation, but implicitly, so that the person themselves may not know this until God reveals it, at least at the Last Judgement.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, all truly deep knowledge, cognition, wisdom is in Christ, although it may be <q>as if hidden</q>, that is, requires revelation, and this revelation is impossible if God does not give it, and people do not cooperate in this with God. But when such revelation happens, it means God reveals, and people cooperate with God. And this is directly connected with the Incarnate Son of God.

<reading>(Luke IX, 12-18 ) </reading><br>
Luke IX, 12 — &#39;εἰς τὰς κύκλῳ κώμας&#39; - &#39;eis tas kyklo komas&#39; - <q>to the surrounding villages</q>. Where to. &#39;ἐν ἐρήμῳ τόπῳ&#39; - &#39;en eremo topo&#39; - <q>in a deserted place</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 13 — &#39;εἰς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον&#39; - &#39;eis panta ton laon touton&#39; - <q>for all this people</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates for whom that food is.
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 16 — &#39;εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν&#39; - &#39;eis ton ouranon&#39; - <q>to the sky; unto the sky</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke IX, 18 — &#39;ἐν τῷ εἶναι&#39; - &#39;en to einai&#39; - <q>while being; when</q>. By meaning the second translation variant corresponds more to the English language.
</p>
<p>
The miracle of feeding the 5 thousand people, and also the question of Who Jesus is.
