<p>(Acts XIII, 13 - 24) Acts XIII, 15 - ‘παρακλησεως’ - ‘parakleseos’ -
‘comfort, consolation, encouragement, exhortation’ - from the word which
is also ‘Comforter’ as the name of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul (who was formerly Saul) speaks of the history of the Israelite
people of the Old Testament, especially of David, from whom Jesus
Christ, the Saviour, was born according to the promise. God <q>led</q> Him to
the people of Israel, sending John the Baptist before Him with a sermon
of repentance and baptism in anticipation of Christ.</p>
<p>He <q>“subdued the seven nations</q>” - that is, the Israelites, by the
will of God, overcame those nations (the number 7 may also mean that
there were many of them) so that they could make the land their own -
according to God’s promise. The nations became dependent on the
Israelites, <q>lowered</q> from being masters.</p>
<p>(John VI, 5-14) John VI, 6 - ‘εμελλεν’ - ‘emellen’ - <q>had a certain
intention, was ready to do, was about to do</q>.</p>
<p>John VI, 12 - ‘ενεπλησθησαν’ - ‘eneplesthesan’ - ‘were filled
(satisfied)’ - from ‘εμπιπλημι’ - ‘empiplemi’ (which comes from ‘in’ +
‘to fill’).</p>
<p>Jesus’ miracle of feeding 5,000 people with 5 loaves and 2 fish. He
asks the disciples so that they can witness that this is indeed a
miracle. We have recently read about the events that followed and one of
the most important reasons why the Lord performed this miracle. See the
following links:

<p>The order of the readings is chosen to emphasise that the Lord is the
Saviour and the Lover of people.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
