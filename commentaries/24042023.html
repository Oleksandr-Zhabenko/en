<p>Continuation of Peterâ€™s sermon on the healing of
the crooked. About the beginning, see the work at the link:

<p>Acts III, 21  &ndash; <q>times of restoration</q>  &ndash; the time of the Second Coming
of Christ in glory. Some understood the <q>restoration</q> (Î±Ï€Î¿ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÏƒÏ„Î±ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚) to
mean that all intelligent creation would be repented to God and
eventually, even though after suffering, become good and suffer no more.
But in general, the Scriptures do not confirm the end of eternal
sufferings for the devil and those who are with him. On the contrary, it
is always said that the sufferings will not end. Therefore, such an
opinion is not accepted by the Church.</p>
<p>You can better understand this issue after a good work at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a><br></p>
<p>Due to the realization of the freedom of creation, its state in
eternity will be such that it does not change to the opposite  &ndash; joy will
be joy that grows, and sufferings will be sufferings that will not turn
into joy.</p>
<p>Acts III, 22  &ndash; <q>Me</q> is â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™.</p>

<p>Acts III, 26  &ndash; <q>His Servant</q>  &ndash; can also be translated as <q>His Child</q>,
in general, the humiliation of the Son of God is emphasized here.</p>
<p>Peter preaches about Jesus as Godâ€™s Promised Messiah.</p>

<p><reading>(John II, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>The story about the participation of Jesus, the
Mother of God and the apostles in the wedding in Cana of Galilee, as
well as about the first miracle of Jesus  &ndash; the transformation of water
into the best wine (almost non-alcoholic, similar to fresh grape juice,
which I wrote about earlier in other works, see, for example, link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0arr5cMHtvRdvNPZoM6QWNv7Mw33y8i7j13i6ADL3XsqgKtGcojvk6U3B6Z8hQH4Vl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0arr5cMHtvRdvNPZoM6QWNv7Mw33y8i7j13i6ADL3XsqgKtGcojvk6U3B6Z8hQH4Vl</a><br>
).</p>
<p>John II, 4  &ndash; <q>Me</q> is <q>ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹</q>.</p>
<p>A well-known place, I will draw attention to a few subtle
details.</p>
<p>The wine quickly ran out â€” this means that people freely drank and
ate in the presence of Jesus and Mary, the apostles, i.e.Â They were in
no way <q>restraints</q> of the joyful event, the celebration. The Lord, who
created people for a blissful eternity with Him, rejoiced at the
wonderful event of the marriage of His friends.</p>
<p>The Lordâ€™s answer to the Motherâ€™s request is not entirely clear  &ndash; but
in general He fulfills Maryâ€™s request. The somewhat mysterious words of
Jesus become clearer if we look at them as the words of God the Creator,
Who rejoices with people at the joyful event of their marriage. He
already gifted them with marriage, already blessed them with His
presence, already shared and multiplied their joy in an ordinary and
even gracious way  &ndash; and here a miracle is still neededâ€¦ 
This shows that the natural joy from relationships, from association, from the joy of a special event and the like is quite enough, and suddenly â€” here it is needed something extraordinary and supernatural â€” a miracle (the sentence translation edited at 01:43 EEST 2023-04-25). 
The Lord teaches us to value life with this.</p>
<p>The second reason is mystical  &ndash; in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, He
transforms wine into His Blood, and here something else needs to be
transformed into wine. And at the very beginning of the service, while
the Eucharist was at the end. Also, from the pierced rib of Jesus, blood
and water will later flow, which will be witnessed, which is also
understood mysteriously through the creation of human in Paradise and
the union of Christ and His Bride  &ndash; the Church (Eve was created from the
rib of the first Adam, and the Church is established through the
Mysteries of Jesus  &ndash; through water and blood â€” Baptism and Communion).
In Cana, the water must become completely wine, while in the Sacrament
of Communion, the Blood is served under the guise of wine. These are
completely different states. The Lord wants to preserve the uniqueness
of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>But both reasons are not actually an obstacle to Godâ€™s love and
generosity. Therefore, the Lord fulfills the request of the Mother and
creates the first miracle.</p>
<p>This is also instruction for us, because it means that the Lord, Who
created <q>the Sabbath for man, and not man for the Sabbath</q>, does not act
according to some literalism, which seems to be higher than the
well-being of people. No, but He acts out of love for people.</p>
<p>This is how the Lord performed the first miracle, showed the power of
the intercession of the Mother of God and His love for people.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
