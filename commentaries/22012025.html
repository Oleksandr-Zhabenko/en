it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

To the Apostle Timothy from the 70:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy I, 3-9; Luke X, 1-15) </reading><br>
2 Timothy I, 3 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ προγόνων’ - ‘apo progonon’ - ‘from the ancestors’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the countdown from that time. ‘ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει’ - ‘en kathara syneidesei’ - ‘in a clear conscience; with a clear conscience’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that a clear conscience is a consistent feature of Paul's life, and the second that ministry itself requires a clear conscience. The implication is not that Paul had no remorse or repentant moods, but that he consciously and deliberately, consistently devoted his life from childhood to serving God, and chose the path to Him as the main path of his life. This consciousness could be combined in Saul with the persecution of Christians in ignorance, but it was not possible for it to allow Saul to stay that way after his conversion to Christ. ‘ἐν ταῖς δεήσεσίν’ - ‘en tais deesesin’ - ‘in prayers; in supplications’. The second option is more accurate, i.e. it refers to enduring and diligent prayer in faith.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 5, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν σοὶ’ - ‘en soi’ - ‘in you’. ‘ἐν τῇ μάμμῃ σου Λωΐδι καὶ τῇ μητρί σου Εὐνίκῃ’ - ‘en te mamme sou Loidi kai te metri sou Eunike’ - ‘in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice’. 
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Christ Jesus; by Christ Jesus’. Both translations are possible, the second indicating that Christ Himself is the Source of grace.
