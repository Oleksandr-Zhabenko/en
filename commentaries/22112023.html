A continuation of the reading that I wrote about at the link, which has verses in common with it (2 Thessalonians II, 1-2):<br>

<p>
As I wrote earlier, the apostle Paul, following the Old Testament people, sometimes does not distinguish between God's permission (what God does not want but permits) and God's will (what God wants). This is an example of such a failure to distinguish: where it means <q>God will permit</q> people to have an antichrist (God does not want him to be like that, but will permit it), Paul writes <q>God will send</q> people an antichrist.<br>
</p>
<p>
See the need for this distinction and the fact that it is made in the Gospel at the following links:<br>
<a class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30062023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30062023.html</a>

and other references cited there.<br>
</p>
<p>
Overall, it is a mysterious place that is often understood in different ways. Most believe that the antichrist here is a real person who will appear before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, this place is one of the most explicit indications of the reality (rather than symbolism or allegory) of the antichrist.<br>
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the Gospels do not pay much attention to the topic of his appearance, with only indirect mentions and references to Old Testament prophecies, which makes it difficult to understand. This may be because speculation about the antichrist is often unfounded and ultimately leads to unbelief in many people.<br>
</p>
<p>
There are also different opinions as to what is meant by <q>who or what is holding back</q> the appearance of the antichrist. For example, there is an opinion that it is the Holy Spirit, or another that it is the former Roman (legal) state (we could now say strong international law and state authorities), and there are other opinions.<br>
</p>
<p>
The whole logic of the construction and actions of the antichrist is based on the fact that the devil would like to see him come as soon as possible, and something from God is holding back the fulfilment of this desire. <br>
</p>
<p>
It is also often understood that people's repentance <q>delays</q> the time of the end of the world, while people's thoughtlessness and unrepentant sins bring it closer. God knows the exact time and all the circumstances as the Omniscient One, but from the point of view of people, events look exactly like this.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is also important that the antichrist should not be the focus of the faithful, because the faithful belong to God. But it is also wrong to ignore what is known about him, because it is revealed by God to people.<br>

<reading>(Luke XVIII, 15-17, 26-30) </reading><br>
I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew earlier, see the links:<br>
<a class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/01082023.html</a>

<p>
As for the reward for the faithful and Peter's question, it is about the determination needed to live in accordance with God's will, and about selflessness, when a person is ready to change for the glory of God, overcoming various attachments. Marriage should be cherished, and parents should be respected and loved, and children should be loved and cared for, and here we are talking about a person's willingness not to seek marriage for the sake of God's Kingdom, to continue to do God's will even if parents are against it, not to try to <q>appease</q> children by renouncing their faith for the sake of some <q>innovations</q>, etc. - there can be many situations of this kind, and a faithful person can be faithful by God's grace, but this requires both determination and selflessness.<br>
</p>
<p>
We need to remember that Peter was married. He did not leave his wife, but for the sake of his apostleship he devoted his time and life to serving Christ.<br>
</p>
<p>
Christ's words should be taken as an encouragement to all believers in similar situations, for they are a promise of salvation and God's blessing.<br>
</p>
<p>
To the apostles Philemon, Archippus, and the holy co-apostolic martyr Apphia:<br>
<reading>(Philemon I, 1-25; Luke X, 1-15) </reading><br>
The Epistle to Philemon is addressed to these saints. Onesimus was a slave of Philemon, ran away from him, and then Paul converted both of them separately to the faith. In the letter, he asks Philemon to forgive Onesimus and to let him go free as a brother and co-worker in Christ. For this he is willing to sacrifice himself in the hope of being released from imprisonment for Christ. Tradition says that Philemon did release Onesimus and they all helped Paul.<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 1-3 - '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 6 - '·º°Œº·øñŒΩ' - 'emin' - 'us' ((in) us).<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 10 - '·ºêŒºŒø·ø¶' - 'emou' - 'me' (my).<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 11, 16, 18 - '·ºêŒºŒø·Ω∂' - 'emoi' - 'me'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 12 - '·ºêŒº·Ω∞' - 'ema' - 'mine'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 13 - '·ºêŒºŒ±œÖœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ' - 'emauton' - 'me (myself)' ((in) myself).<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 17 - '·ºêŒºŒ≠' - 'eme' - 'me'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Philemon I, 19 - '·ºêŒº·øá' - 'eme' - 'my' (my own).<br>
