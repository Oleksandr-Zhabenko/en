<p><reading>(Ephesians V, 33  &ndash; VI, 9) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading is a continuation of
yesterday’s, which can be found here (and has verse 33 in common):
<br><a class="link2" href="04102023.html">04102023.html</a><br></p>
<p>In general, Paul in the reading teaches honour and respect for
people, regardless of their position, both for personal and social
relations and conditions, circumstances. After all, parents and children
are bound by personal relationships, and masters and slaves were bound
by social relationships, mostly because of the social order. Both
examples (and all those in between) are aimed at making believers
understand that they are equal in the eyes of God, that the Lord is Lord
(Master) over all, that doing God’s will is more important than social
position.</p>
<p>We can also say that what the apostle warns against here is a
manifestation of disrespect. The faithful are called not only to respect
but also to love, but deep, true love is impossible without respect for
the dignity of the other person as well as one’s own.</p>
<p>Some people think that Paul does not consider slavery to be a bad
thing. Firstly, it must be said that Paul nowhere praises or glorifies
slavery either in general or in its essence. So, Paul does not justify
slavery. Nor does he call for its overthrow. In order to overthrow
slavery, a rebellion was necessary. It was not God’s will for such a
rebellion to take place at that time, so Paul does not write anything
about it. He also mentions Moses, who, by God’s will, led the Israelites
out of slavery in even more ancient times, when society was much less
developed.</p>
<p>Paul also says that work that is not sinful should be done
diligently, sincerely, wholeheartedly, and in faith.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke VII, 17-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke VII, 20  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>Luke VIi, 23  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (in) ‘Me’ ((through) Me).</p>
<p>Luke VII, 25  &ndash; ‘ημφιεσμενον’  &ndash; ‘emphiesmenon’  &ndash; ‘clothed’  &ndash; from
‘αμφιεννυμι’  &ndash; ‘amphiennymi’  &ndash; ‘to clothe’.</p>
<p>Luke VII, 27  &ndash; ‘εμπροσθεν’  &ndash; ‘emprosthen’  &ndash; ‘before; in front of the
face’.</p>
<p>For the parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew XI, 2-6), see the link
(the same link also refers to the reading from Luke):

<p>The following link is also important for understanding:
<br><a class="link2" href="27062023.html">27062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>I would add that it is generally agreed that John the Baptist knew
Who Jesus was, but he sent his disciples to see for themselves so that
their faith would not be based on the testimony of John alone.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is also generally called <q>the least in the Kingdom of
God</q>. We must also remember that He was born not of a woman, but of a
Virgin.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
