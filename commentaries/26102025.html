Here is meant, since there stands a negation, that the apostle Paul did not learn from some human being, as many other preachers often do, learning and receiving knowledge from people who teach under the action of the Holy Spirit for the glorification of the Incarnate Son of God, but Paul received the gift of preaching through direct Revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ. Emphasises the importance of preaching, teaching, but at the same time also the exceptional value of apostolic ministry."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<reading>(Galatians I, 11-19) </reading><br>
Galatians I, 11 — &#39;τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν ὑπ&#39; ἐμοῦ&#39; - &#39;to euangelion to euangelisthen hyp emou&#39; - <q>the Gospel preached by me</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; in its form before the following vowel here with genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle <q>preached</q> and who preached — Paul.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 12 — &#39;παρὰ ἀνθρώπου&#39; - &#39;para anthropou&#39; - <q>from beside a human being</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; is here with genitive case. Such a construction is used regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02082025.html</a><br>
Here is meant, since there stands a negation, that the apostle Paul did not learn from some human being, as many other preachers often do, learning and receiving knowledge from people who teach under the action of the Holy Spirit for the glorification of the Incarnate Son of God, but Paul received the gift of preaching through direct Revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ. Emphasises the importance of preaching, teaching, but at the same time also the exceptional value of apostolic ministry.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 13, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῷ Ἰουδαϊσμῷ&#39; - &#39;en to Ioudaismo&#39; - <q>in Judaism</q>. That is, in what faith and Tradition.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῷ γένει μου&#39; - &#39;en to genei mou&#39; - <q>in my kindred; among my kindred</q>. Where, there is also a certain comparison here with surroundings and relatives.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 15 — &#39;ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου&#39; - &#39;ek koilias metros mou&#39; - <q>from my mother&#39;s womb</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here origin, and not time. That is, the constancy of God&#39;s election is emphasised, and not a certain moment in time. See also similar at the links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 16 — &#39;ἐν ἐμοὶ&#39; - &#39;en emoi&#39; - <q>in me; with me</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first indicates that Paul represents Christ by God&#39;s will, and the second — that Paul as God&#39;s servant (more precisely as an instrument in God&#39;s hands) manifests Christ to others. &#39;ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν&#39; - &#39;en tois ethnesin&#39; - <q>among the Gentiles; among the nations</q>. All translation variants are possible, since the word is multivalent.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 17, 18 — &#39;εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα&#39; - &#39;eis Hierosolyma&#39; - <q>to Jerusalem</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς Ἀραβίαν&#39; - &#39;eis Arabian&#39; - <q>to Arabia</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς Δαμασκόν&#39; - &#39;eis Damaskon&#39; - <q>to Damascus</q>. Where to.
