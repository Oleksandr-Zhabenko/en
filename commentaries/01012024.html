<meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul briefly opposes possible teachings about the need for Christians from the Gentiles to be circumcised (he wrote more elsewhere), but his main point is that Baptism for Christians has the same functions as circumcision for Jews, but exceeds the latter in power and union with Christ. Whereas circumcision made one part of God's Covenant, but did not unite one to God directly, Baptism unites one to Christ through participation in His Resurrection (in the power of the Sacrament). Paul rejects the opposite view. It is also a testimony to the fact that Christ is the perfect God (and the perfect human being, I might add). Here I will focus on the difference and the combination of two words concerning the growth and development of Jesus, in verses 40 and 52. The phrases in which the words are used are similar, but the verbs are different. And the ages are different. We can conclude that the first - 'filled up' - refers to a younger age, and the second - 'grew; progressed' - to a period of growing up and maturing, becoming mature. The former implies less activity of the child, while the latter means much more personal activity. It cannot be said that 'suddenly at the age of 12' Jesus began to develop actively as a person, but these words are used in relation to His human nature - just as a person (and all people) need more and more personal activity as they grow up and mature, so these processes took place in Jesus. And in this He is an example for everyone. We can also say that this is a difference in awareness, in self-awareness. As a small child, Jesus (like other people, children) 'accepted' more, and as an adult, He interacted more actively. The parallel is with the first martyr Stephen, whose suffering was once witnessed by Saul himself, who later converted and became Paul; speaking of his future martyrdom, Paul draws a parallel with Stephen as now a fellow believer in Christ.">

The reading from the Apostle is preceded by the one referred to here:<br>

The Apostle Paul speaks briefly against possible teachings about the need for a Christian from the Gentiles to be circumcised (he wrote more elsewhere), but his main point is that baptism for Christians has the same functions as circumcision for Jews, but exceeds the latter in power and union with Christ. Whereas circumcision made a person part of God's Testament, but did not unite them directly to God, Baptism unites them to Christ through participation in His Resurrection (in the power of the Sacrament). Paul rejects the opposite view.
</p>
<p>
It is also a testimony to the fact that Christ is the perfect God (and the perfect man, we might add).
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 21 &mdash; 'ἡμέραι' - 'emerai' - 'days' (days). 'κοιλίᾳ' - 'koilia' - 'belly; womb; inner man' (here actually 'womb').
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 40 &mdash; 'πληρούμενον' - 'pleroumenon' - 'filled up; fulfilled'.
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 43, 46 &mdash; 'ἡμέρας' - 'emeras' - 'days'.
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 44 &mdash; 'ἡμέρας' - 'emeras' - 'day'.
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 48 &mdash; 'ἡμῖν' - 'emin' - (to) 'us'.
</p>
<p>
Luke II, 52 &mdash; 'προέκοπτεν' - 'proekopten' - 'progressed; developed (in a good direction)'.
</p>
<p>
Here I will focus on the difference and the combination of the two words for growth and development in verses 40 and 52. The phrases in which the words are used are similar, but the verbs are different. And the ages are different. We can conclude that the first, <q>filled up</q>, refers to a younger age, and the second, <q>grew; progressed</q>, to a period of growing up and maturing, becoming mature. The first implies less activity of the child, and the second means much more personal activity. We cannot say that <q>suddenly at the age of 12</q> Jesus began to develop actively as a person, but these words are used in relation to His human nature &mdash; just as a person (and all people) need more and more personal activity as they grow up and become mature, so these processes took place in Jesus. And in this He is an example for everyone. We can also say that this is a difference in awareness, in self-awareness, self-consciousness. As a small child, Jesus (like other people, children) <q>accepted</q> more, and as an adult, He interacted more actively.

Of the Sunday before the Epiphany:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy IV, 5-8; Mark I, 1-8) </reading><br>
A direct continuation of today's reading from the Apostle is the one that I wrote about here:<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13122023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/13122023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy IV, 5 &mdash; 'πληροφόρησον' - 'plerophoreson' - <q>finished, filled (brought to completeness)</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy IV, 7 &mdash; 'τετέλεκα' - 'teteleka' - 'completed, finished, accomplished, ended' - from 'τελέω'. 'τετήρηκα' - 'tetereka' - 'preserved, kept' - from 'τηρέω'. A peculiar versification in the words of the apostle.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy IV, 8 &mdash; 'δικαιοσύνης στέφανος' - 'dikaiosynes stephanos' - 'crown of righteousness' (a parallel to the first martyr Stephen, whose suffering was once witnessed by Saul himself, who later converted and became Paul; speaking of his future martyrdom, Paul draws a parallel to Stephen as a brother in Christ). 'ἡμέρᾳ' - 'emera' - (of the) 'day'. 'ἐμοὶ' - 'emoi' - (to) 'me'.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul testifies to his ministry, which was approaching its martyrdom and the crown of glory from the Lord, as having been well fulfilled. This is an example of how the awareness of good work and service does not contradict humility. See also this link (in Ukrainian):<br>

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Matthew6-3.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Matthew6-3.html</a>
</p>
<p>
In these words, Paul also calls for similar diligence (and, possibly, fruitfulness) in the work of all believers.
</p>
<p>
Mark I, 7 &mdash; 'εἰμὶ' - 'eimi' - (I am not) 'is'. It is used for emphasis.
</p>
<p>
The reading from the Gospel is a direct continuation of the one I wrote about here:<br>

The Gospel of Mark begins with the sermon of John the Baptist, the Forerunner of the Lord. See more here:<br>
