<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XVI, 13-24) </reading>
</p>
<p>Conclusion of the epistle.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 16:18  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜myâ€™.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 16:21  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î·â€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™  &ndash; â€˜myâ€™ (mine).</p>
<p>Paul greets the addressees, encourages them to show love and respect,
in particular to those who work in the Lordâ€™s field, and reminds them of
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The <q>holy kiss</q> is a friendly greeting. To learn more about kisses,

<p>The epistle was written from dictation, and at the end Paul himself
signed it with his own hand as a sign of its correctness.</p>
<p>As for the <q>anathema</q> at the end, this is the only letter with such
an ending. All believers should have at least a small measure of
heartfelt love for Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer, the Lord. If
they do not have a drop of this sincere love, they are not Christians,
and therefore, having a pretence of faith, they deny it, and therefore
will not be part of the Church (which is what the word <q>anathema</q> means
in its proper sense). Paul thus reminds us that if any Christian does
not love Jesus even a little bit, they will be excommunicated from the
Church (separated of their own will). This is not a curse, but a warning
and a reminder.</p>
<p>The letter ends with a wish of grace and an assurance of love for the
recipients of the letter.</p>

<p>Matthew XXI, 42  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™
(ours).</p>
<p>The Parable of the Criminal Wine Makers is briefly explained here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0XRy5h4QVFJrTQERRFFNinb8NamBKGdCmutLybh5YvMdVprzr1DSA5nmudE3RSZVql">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>The quote about the cornerstone is found in Isaiah XXVIII, 16 and
Psalm CXVIII, 22. I previously wrote about the context of the prophecy
in Isaiah:
<br><a class="link2" href="23032023.html">23032023.html</a></p>
<p>A continuation of this reading is the one referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="10082023.html">10082023.html</a></p>
<p>I will add that it is known that this parable is about the Israelite
elders and their followers who persecuted many prophets and went as far
as to commit God-murder  &ndash; crucify Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The
servants and the son in the parable represent the prophets and
Jesus.</p>
<p>Although the parable itself is about the elders of the nation of
Israel and their followers, it is a warning to all, because similar
temptations arose in later times, for example, many followers of Jesus
Christ were also persecuted. The parable warns everyone against this and
also shows that the Lord is a Righteous Judge.</p>
<p>It also shows what prompted people to persecute Godâ€™s faithful and
Christ Himself  &ndash; the desire to appropriate Godâ€™s things for themselves,
which is actually synonymous with arrogance. Many other sins come from
arrogance, and arrogance itself was the root cause of the fall, so the
Lord teaches us not to be arrogant but to be humble.</p>

<p>To the Hieromartyr Anfim, Bishop of Nicomedia: (Hebrews XIII, 7-16;
John X, 9-16) For a frequent reading from the Apostle, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="14052023.html">14052023.html</a></p>
<p>John X, 9, 11, 14  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is used only with
emphasis. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John X, 14  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±â€™  &ndash; â€˜emaâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Myâ€™.</p>
<p>The very image of the door and the pasture is well described here:
