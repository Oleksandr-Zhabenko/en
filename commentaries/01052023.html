<p><reading>(Acts VI, 8  &ndash; VII, 5, 47-60) </reading>
</p>
<p>Acts VI, 9  &ndash; <q>Libertine</q>  &ndash; that is, the
one that consisted of freed former Roman slaves (this is their common
name  &ndash; Libertines).</p>
<p>The description of Stephenâ€™s martyrdom (abridged, since the whole of
chapter 7 is devoted first to his defence and expository speech,
preaching, and then to his martyrdom.</p>
<p>Stephen thus became the first martyr for Jesus Christ specifically
(as a follower of Jesus Christ for his faith in Him). The accusations of
the Jews were similar to the accusations they had made against Jesus,
and were also based on false testimony, and 
<a class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Power.html">just like Jesus,</a>
 Stephen
overcame these accusations. In his preaching, he tells the story of the
salvation of the Old Testament Church, starting with Abraham, the
ancestor of the Jews, to whom God gave His promises.</p>
<p>Since Stephen was accused of blaspheming the temple and the Law, he
speaks about them  &ndash; absolutely correctly and in the spirit of both the
Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>But this is not just a debate among scholars about the truth, but a
testimony to the power of God that fills the faithful in the name of
Jesus in the Holy Spirit  &ndash; signs of which were Stephenâ€™s glory (the
radiance of grace, which later became known as nimbus) as he spoke, and
the revelation of Jesus Christ Himself to him in His and the Fatherâ€™s
glory.</p>
<p>Stephen was sentenced most of all for this glory, because the Jews
themselves had nothing like it, which finally exposed them as opposed to
the truth, to God.</p>
<p>I would also add that Saul, who later became the Apostle Paul, is
mentioned as a witness to Stephenâ€™s execution.</p>
<p>Stephen prays for his enemies, like Jesus, and is not afraid of
death.</p>
<p>His name is translated as <q>crown</q> and has become a common symbol of
martyrdom and victory.</p>

<p><reading>(John IV, 46-54) </reading>
</p>
<p>The town to which the nobleman went was
geographically higher than the place where his own home was, so the
original uses the word â€˜come downâ€™ twice: where he asks Jesus for
healing and where he returns home. In the first place, the words thus
have a double meaning  &ndash; a literal geographical one and a spiritual one,
which is more important  &ndash; the latter showing the humility and faith of
the nobleman. The miracle is similar to several others performed by
Jesus that are described in the Gospels.</p>
<p>What makes it special is that the man believed Jesusâ€™ word about
healing over a distance (the same situation was with the Roman centurion
and his servant, whose faith Jesus praised), and that he clarifies when
it happened to be sure that it was a miracle of Jesus. He did not
witness the healing himself, but he trusts the word of the servants, who
knew nothing about the story of Jesus except that the father had gone to
him to ask for healing.</p>
<p>For us, this is a lesson that Godâ€™s action (here, a miracle) can be
broader than we can personally accommodate, involve more people, and
when their participation is credible, we should accept their testimony
as if we were witnesses ourselves, with similar trust.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
