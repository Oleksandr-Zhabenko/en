<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Ephesians IV, 12 — &amp;#39;πρὸς τὸν καταρτισμὸν τῶν ἁγίων&amp;#39; — &amp;#39;pros ton katartismon ton hagion&amp;#39; - toward the perfecting (becoming complete, fully accomplished) of the saints. The preposition &amp;#39;pros&amp;#39; used with the accusative indicates that it is spoken not so much about the purpose, but about the movement toward becoming perfect, complete. That is the Lord established various gifts and ministries in this verse not so that people all become perfectly holy, but so that people may come to perfect holiness. God&amp;#39;s gifts do not make you perfectly holy, but lead you to this perfection. And likewise regarding not only each person, but also the Church as a community of the faithful. Perfectly holy is not that person whom God extraordinarily gifted, but that one who thanks to God&amp;#39;s gifts constantly strives toward perfect holiness, unites themselves with God (let us remember the Most Pure Virgin Mary). εἰς ἔργον διακονίας&amp;#39; - &amp;#39;eis ergon diakonias&amp;#39; - for the work of ministry. εἰς οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ&amp;#39; - &amp;#39;eis oikodomen tou somatos tou CHristou&amp;#39; - for the building up of the Body of Christ. The preposition &amp;#39;eis&amp;#39; here indicates the purpose of the action. Ephesians IV, 13 — &amp;#39;μέχρι καταντήσωμεν οἱ πάντες εἰς τὴν ἑνότητα τῆς πίστεως καὶ τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ, εἰς ἄνδρα τέλειον, εἰς μέτρον ἡλικίας τοῦ πληρώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ&amp;#39; — &amp;#39;mekhri katantesomen hoi pantes eis ten henoteta tes pisteos kai tes epignoseos tou hyiou tou theou, eis andra teleion, eis metron helikias tou pleromatos tou CHristou&amp;#39; - until we all may attain (come together for the inheritance) to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature (perfect, accomplished) man, to the measure of the stature (maturity) of the fullness of Christ. A holistic complex expression, which testifies that the Church all together, in its unity and fullness, through the wealth of gifts can (is able and moves toward this as a goal) bring the faithful to the likeness of the mature Christ in His life, to the revelation of the depth of Christ&amp;#39;s ministry and His significance for humanity, to the accomplishment, bringing to revelation of God&amp;#39;s design regarding the Incarnation and the salvation of people. Here in comparison with the previous verse it is precisely spoken about the ultimate goal of the movement toward holiness."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
Of Sunday after the Theophany:<br>
<reading>(Ephesians IV, 7-13) </reading><br>
Ephesians IV, 8 — &#39;εἰς ὕψος&#39; — &#39;eis hypsos&#39; - <q>into high</q>. Where to. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 9 — &#39;εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς&#39; — &#39;eis ta katotera mere tes ges&#39; - <q>into the lower parts of the earth</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 10 — &#39;ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν&#39; - &#39;hyperano panton ton ouranon&#39; - <q>far above all the heavens</q>. That is precisely the confirmation of <q>the above-heavens</q>, when it is spoken about the Ascension of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 12 — &#39;πρὸς τὸν καταρτισμὸν τῶν ἁγίων&#39; — &#39;pros ton katartismon ton hagion&#39; - <q>toward the perfecting (becoming complete, fully accomplished) of the saints</q>. The preposition &#39;pros&#39; used with the accusative indicates that it is spoken not so much about the purpose, but about the movement toward becoming perfect, complete. That is the Lord established various gifts and ministries in this verse not so that people all become perfectly holy, but so that people may come to perfect holiness. God&#39;s gifts do not make you perfectly holy, but lead you to this perfection. And likewise regarding not only each person, but also the Church as a community of the faithful. Perfectly holy is not that person whom God extraordinarily gifted, but that one who thanks to God&#39;s gifts constantly strives toward perfect holiness, unites themselves with God (let us remember the Most Pure Virgin Mary). &#39;εἰς ἔργον διακονίας&#39; - &#39;eis ergon diakonias&#39; - <q>for the work of ministry</q>. &#39;εἰς οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;eis oikodomen tou somatos tou CHristou&#39; - <q>for the building up of the Body of Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates the purpose of the action.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 13 — &#39;μέχρι καταντήσωμεν οἱ πάντες εἰς τὴν ἑνότητα τῆς πίστεως καὶ τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ, εἰς ἄνδρα τέλειον, εἰς μέτρον ἡλικίας τοῦ πληρώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; — &#39;mekhri katantesomen hoi pantes eis ten henoteta tes pisteos kai tes epignoseos tou hyiou tou theou, eis andra teleion, eis metron helikias tou pleromatos tou CHristou&#39; - <q>until we all may attain (come together for the inheritance) to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature (perfect, accomplished) man, to the measure of the stature (maturity) of the fullness of Christ</q>. A holistic complex expression, which testifies that the Church all together, in its unity and fullness, through the wealth of gifts can (is able and moves toward this as a goal) bring the faithful to the likeness of the mature Christ in His life, to the revelation of the depth of Christ&#39;s ministry and His significance for humanity, to the accomplishment, bringing to revelation of God&#39;s design regarding the Incarnation and the salvation of people. Here in comparison with the previous verse it is precisely spoken about the ultimate goal of the movement toward holiness.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul quotes Psalm 67 (68) verse 19 (or in other translations — 18). This psalm is prophetic about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and His victory over evil, the beginning of it is very well-known and is read as a Paschal prayer.
</p>
<p>
An important reading, where Paul testifies that God granted people gifts so that the Church would be built up and so that the faithful would be likened to Christ up to the maximum possible measure — likeness to Christ Himself in His maturity and ministry.
</p>
<p>
One can also say that through the gifts of the Holy Spirit, through Christ Himself, through the love of the Father the faithful can be likened to the adult, mature Christ, be God-like in all depth, just as the entire depth of the Saviour&#39;s ministry was revealed precisely in mature age.
</p>

<reading>(Matthew IV, 12-17) </reading><br>
Matthew IV, 12 — &#39;εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν&#39; — &#39;eis ten Galilaian&#39; - <q>into Galilee</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IV, 13 — &#39;εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ&#39; — &#39;eis Kapharnaoum&#39; - <q>to Capernaum</q>. Where to. &#39;ἐν ὁρίοις Ζαβουλὼν καὶ Νεφθαλείμ&#39; - &#39;en horiois Zaboulon kai Nephthaleim&#39; - <q>in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IV, 16 — &#39;ἐν σκότει&#39; — &#39;en skotei&#39; - <q>in darkness</q>. &#39;ἐν χώρᾳ καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου&#39; - &#39;en khora kai skia thanatou&#39; - <q>in the land (region) and shadow of death</q>. That is those who are in the surrounding of death, who through this are to die — those people saw God&#39;s manifestation and salvation in Christ.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IV, 17 — &#39;Ἀπὸ τότε&#39; — &#39;Apo tote&#39; - <q>from then</q>. A common expression, the preposition indicates the beginning of the count of time from that moment.
</p>
<p>
From the Gospel was read about the beginning of the preaching of Jesus Christ and the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah. All note the parallel between the preaching of repentance by John and by Jesus. And also the difference, because the first testifies about the ministry of the Second, and Jesus — begins with testimony about the purpose of the Coming — the Kingdom of Heaven (of God).
