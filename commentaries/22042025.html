<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Luke XXIV, 27 — ἀπὸ Μωϋσέως καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν - apo Moyseos kai apo panton ton propheton - from Moses and from all the Prophets. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the count, but it also implies that the conversation was not about the letter of Scripture, but about the general nature of understanding the meaning of the Old Testament. Christ did not analyse every passage, but spoke about the logic and meaning in general, in a general way, but in greater or lesser detail. The sun will retain the nature of the sun, and so will the moon, but their behaviour and actions will be so different from their usual and characteristic ones that it will be almost like the complete opposite. There may also be a parallel here to some well-known astronomical phenomena, such as solar and lunar eclipses (the so-called ‘red moon’). The first one also indicates that actions in certain cases can mean more, be  more significant than nature."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts II, 14-21) </reading><br>
more siActs II, 17, 18 — <q>ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις</q> - <q>en tais eskhatais hemerais</q> - <q>in the last days</q>. When. 'ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός μου' - <q>ekkheo apo tou pneumatos mou</q> - <q>I will pour out from My Spirit</q>. That is, these events will happen through the Holy Spirit, His action. The preposition <q>apo</q> indicates here that it will be God's gift to people.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 18 — <q>ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις</q> - <q>en tais hemerais ekeinais</q> - <q>in those days</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 19 — ‘τέρατα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω’ - ‘terata en to ourano ano’ - ‘wonders in the heaven above’. Rather, this refers to the visible, physical sky.
</p>
<p>
Acts II, 20 — <q>ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα</q> - <q>ho helios metastraphesetai eis skotos kai he selene eis haima</q> - <q>the sun will be changed into darkness and the moon into blood</q>. The preposition <q>eis</q> indicates what they will be changed into. The sun will retain the nature of the sun, and so will the moon, but their behaviour and actions will be so different from their usual and characteristic ones that it will be almost like the complete opposite. There may also be a parallel here to some well-known astronomical phenomena, such as solar and lunar eclipses (the so-called ‘red moon’). The first one also indicates that actions in certain cases can mean more, be  more significant than nature.

<reading>(Luke XXIV, 12-35) </reading><br>
Luke XXIV, 13 — <q>δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν</q> - <q>duo ex auton</q> - <q>two of them</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> in its form before the following vowel indicates here that those disciples were with the apostles, the tradition, along with the apostle of 70 (72) Cleopas mentioned in the text, also names Luke, the author of the Gospel and the book of Acts, my beloved Saint. Critics think it could hardly be him, but there are no real strong arguments against it (apart from the likely origin and the late mention in Acts as late as chapter 16). Today is also one of the Days of Remembrance of Saint Luke, so it's a double reason to remember him. 'ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ' - <q>en aute te hemera</q> - <q>on that day</q>. That is, on the first day after the Sabbath, on the very Day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. 'εἰς κώμην' - <q>eis komen</q> - <q>into the village</q>. Where to. 'σταδίους ἑξήκοντα ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ' - <q>stadious hexekonta apo Ierousalem</q> - <q>sixty stadia from Jerusalem</q>. The preposition <q>apo</q> indicates that it is a distance from Jerusalem. It is not very far by modern standards, even then, but it was enough to walk for hours.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 15 — <q>ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὁμιλεῖν αὐτοὺς καὶ συνζητεῖν</q> - <q>egeneto en to homilein autous kai synzetein</q> - ‘happened in their conversation (talking) and seeking (discussion)’. The apostles (Cleopas was also a relative of Jesus on the side of His Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary) were just talking about the suffering and death of Jesus in Jerusalem two days ago, trying to understand, having different views, and presumably analysing.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 18 — <q>τὰ γενόμενα ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις</q> - <q>ta genemena en aute en tais hemerais tautais</q> - <q>those (events) that happened in it in these days</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 19 — ‘ἀνὴρ προφήτης δυνατὸς ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ’ - <q>aner prophetes dynatos en ergo kai logo enantion tou theou kai pantos tou laou</q> - <q>a man-prophet, strong in deed and word before God and all the people (of Israel)</q>. In other words, righteous and holy, a model for all, a true prophet.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 20 — <q>εἰς κρίμα θανάτου</q> - <q>eis krima thanatou</q> - <q>into the judgement of death; into the sentence of death; into the death sentence</q>. That is, what they did to Him was deliberate on the part of the crucifiers.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 21 — <q>ἀφ</q> οὗ' - <q>aph hou</q> - ‘from that’. The preposition <q>apo</q> in its form before the following <q>hou</q> indicates here the beginning of the count.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 22 — ‘καὶ γυναῖκές τινες ἐξ ἡμῶν’ - ‘kai gynaikes tines ex hemon’ - ‘and some women from us’. The preposition <q>ek</q> in its form before the following <q>he</q> indicates here that these women were also disciples of Christ, like the apostles, and shared the grief of those events.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 26 — <q>εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ</q> - <q>eiselthein eis ten doxan autou</q> - <q>to enter into His glory</q>. That is, where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 27 — <q>ἀπὸ Μωϋσέως καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν</q> - <q>apo Moyseos kai apo panton ton propheton</q> - <q>from Moses and from all the Prophets</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates the beginning of the count, but it also implies that the conversation was not about the letter of Scripture, but about the general nature of understanding the meaning of the Old Testament. Christ did not analyse every passage, but spoke about the logic and meaning in general, in a general way, but in greater or lesser detail. 'ἐν πάσαις ταῖς γραφαῖς' - <q>en pasais tais graphais</q> - <q>in all the Scriptures (here in the plural, i.e. in all the books of the Old Testament)</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 28 — <q>εἰς τὴν κώμην</q> - <q>eis ten komen</q> - <q>to the settlement; to the village</q>. That is, near Emmaus. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 30 — ‘ἐν τῷ κατακλιθῆναι αὐτὸν μετ’ αὐτῶν' - ‘en to kataklithenai auton met auton’ - ‘when He reclined (for a meal, then ate lying down) with them’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 31 — <q>αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ</q> αὐτῶν' - <q>autos aphantos egeneto ap auton</q> - <q>He became implicit (invisible, disappearing, hidden) from them</q>. That is, he disappeared from their perception, became invisible and inaudible to them. The preposition <q>apo</q> in its form before the next vowel indicates here that He has become implicit, invisible, not perceptible to the senses.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 32, 35 — ‘ἐν ἡμῖν’ - ‘en hemin’ - ‘in us’. 'ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ' - <q>en te hodo</q> - <q>on the way</q>. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 33 — <q>εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ</q> - <q>eis Ierousalem</q> - <q>to Jerusalem</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXIV, 35 — ‘ἐν τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου’ - ‘en te klasei tou artou’ - ‘in the breaking of the bread’. That is, during the blessing of the food, which also resembles the Eucharist, since Luke later calls it the breaking of the bread.
