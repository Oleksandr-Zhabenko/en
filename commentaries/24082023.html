<p><reading>(2 Corinthians VII, 1-10) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 1  &ndash; ‘επιτελεουντες’ -
‘epiteleountes’  &ndash; ‘completing, making perfect, accomplished’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 2, 6  &ndash; ‘χωρησατε’  &ndash; ‘khoresate’  &ndash; ‘give place,
room, receive’. ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’. ‘ταπεινους’  &ndash; ‘tapeinous’ -
‘low, lowered, humble’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 3, 4, 5, 9  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (ours, we).
‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘freedom, confidence, openness’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians VII, 7  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; ‘to us’. ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’ -
‘me’.</p>
<p>In verse 8, Paul refers to an earlier letter to the Corinthians. This
could be 1 Corinthians, for it deals specifically with the sins of one
Corinthian and all of them.</p>
<p>Paul often uses the words ‘παρακλησις’  &ndash; ‘paraklesis’  &ndash; ‘comfort,
consolation, encouragement’ and ‘παρακαλεω’  &ndash; ‘parakaleo’  &ndash; ‘to comfort,
console, encourage, exhort’ and their derivatives. The name of the Holy
Spirit is also derived from these words  &ndash; Paraclete, the Comforter. That
is, where Paul writes about comfort from God, he is talking about the
action of God’s grace. The event itself  &ndash; the arrival of Titus  &ndash; can
also be called a gift from God, but it also implies that God helps Titus
to comfort Paul and those with him, a direct action of God’s grace. We
can recall the visitation of Elizabeth by the Virgin Mary, which is a
good essay here:

<p><reading>(Mark I, 29-35) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s reading, which was
referred to here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="23082023.html">23082023.html</a></p>
<p>Here, looking ahead, I will say that it is more obvious that the
demons were increasingly aware that Jesus is the Son of God. Still, the
question remains, in view of what is written in the link above, unclear.
Moreover, the word ‘οτι’ used here can mean both ‘that’ (they knew Him)
and ‘because’. That is, Jesus could forbid them both to show that they
knew Him (at least felt, guessed) and to forbid them because they were
saying that. We can also say that either the demons said they knew or
they <q>did not have time</q>, and the Lord forbade them to do either.</p>
<p>The diseased are called here in Greek ‘κακως εχοντας’  &ndash; literally,
‘those who have substantial evil; those who have something really bad’,
i.e. this word refers to serious illness, although in many other places
in Scripture the first of these words means something ‘morally evil’.
Mark is writing here in a very simple way.</p>
<p>When it comes to the causes of illness and their connection with sin,
it is advisable to distinguish between illness and evil as such (for
example, this is very important when we say that illness is not sin, and
when a person is sick or suffering, it is not their sin, or that all
illnesses are the result of the fall, but not all illnesses are the
result of a person’s sins), but when it comes to human perception, a
person really perceives illness as evil. Mark follows the human
perception in this.</p>
<p>It also refers to the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law, from which we
can also know that Peter was married.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
