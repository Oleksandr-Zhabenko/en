it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(Galatians I, 11-19) </reading><br>
Galatians I, 11 &mdash; ‘ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ‘ - ’yp emou' - <q>under me; through me</q>. The preposition ‘hypo’ in its form before the next vowel is here with the genitive case. The meaning here is the second translation option.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 12 &mdash; ‘παρὰ ἀνθρώπου’ - ‘para anthropou’ - ‘from beside a human being'. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case. The same construction is used for the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father and for the human nature of Jesus Christ. It is meant that essentially, in essence, the Gospel is not human thought, but has God's origin as the Revelation of God.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 13, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ Ἰουδαϊσμῷ’ - ‘en to Ioudaismo’ - ‘in Judaism; by Judaism’. Both translations are possible, but the meaning is approximately the same.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 14 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ γένει’ - ‘en to genei’ - ‘in the nation; among the nation’.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐκ κοιλίας’ - ‘ek koilias’ - ‘from the belly; from the womb’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates origin, not time. That is, the permanence of God's election is emphasised, not a particular moment in time.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἐμοὶ’ - ‘en emoi’ - ‘in me; by me’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that Paul represents Christ by God's will, and the second that Paul, as a servant of God, represents Christ to others. ‘ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν’ - ‘en tois ethnesin’ - ‘among the Gentiles; among the nations’. Both translations are possible, since the word is polysemous.
</p>
<p>
Galatians I, 17, 18 &mdash; ‘εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα’ - ‘eis Ierosalyma’ - ‘to Jerusalem’. ‘εἰς Ἀραβίαν’ - ‘eis Arabian’ - ‘to Arabia’. ‘εἰς Δαμασκόν’ - ‘eis Damaskon’ - ‘to Damascus’.
</p>

<p>
<reading>(Luke X, 25-37) </reading><br>
Luke X, 26 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ νόμῳ’ - ‘en to nomo’ - ‘in the Law’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 27 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας’ - ‘ex holes tes kardias’ - ‘from the whole heart’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘ho’ indicates the origin of love for God - it must be sincere, heartfelt, and reveal the heart of a person. ‘ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ’ - ‘en hole te psykhe’ - ‘in the whole soul; with the whole soul’. ‘ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ἰσχύϊ’ - ‘en hole te iskhyi’ - ‘in all strength; with all strength’. ‘ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ διανοίᾳ’ - ‘en hole te dianoia’ - ‘in all mind; with all mind’. Both translations are possible everywhere, with the second being the most common. The first option indicates the substantive content of the soul, strength, and mind - that is, what they should be filled with - and the second option more generally and completely refers to the soul, strength, and mind as such, in their entirety. According to the logic of the commandment, the second option is preferable.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 30 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς Ἱερειχώ’ - ‘apo Ierousalem eis Iereikho’ - ‘from Jerusalem to Jericho; leaving Jerusalem, to Jericho’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 31 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ’ - ‘en to hodo’ - ‘on the way’. Both translations are possible.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 34 &mdash; ‘εἰς πανδοκίον’ - ‘eis pandokion’ - ‘into an inn’.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 35 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἐπανέρχεσθαί’ - ‘en to epanerkhesthai’ - ‘on the return’. That is, ‘on the return, during the return’.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 36 &mdash; ‘εἰς τοὺς λῃστάς’ - ‘eis tous lestas’ - ‘to the robbers’. That is, ‘into the hands of robbers’.
