<p>All calendars are astronomically inaccurate, and this inaccuracy is
only growing over time, so <q>calendar adjustment</q> is a necessary thing at
certain times (just as clocks sometimes need to be synchronised).</p>
<p>This time has come for Ukraine today.</p>
<p>Starting today, we are switching to the New Julian calendar, which is
more accurate from an astronomical point of view and more precise than
the Gregorian calendar used in Western Europe and the world. Until 2800,
they coincide. In 2800 (if the Second Coming of Jesus Christ does not
take place by then), there will be a discrepancy again (1 day, but in
2900 it will disappear again). The New Julian calendar, like all others,
is also not absolutely accurate, but the error of 1 day will <q>run up</q>
over a period of 43,500 years (to put it simply). For many needs, this
is quite enough at this stage of human development.</p>
<p>Source of scientific information:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Julian_calendar</p>
<p>To the Church’s indictum: (1 Timothy II, 1-7; Luke IV, 16-22) 1
Timothy II, 3  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>1 Timothy II, 1  &ndash; four types of prayer are listed. We can say that
they differ in the way they are performed and their purpose. <q>Prayer (a
long attentive prayer of petition), exalted prayers (characterised by
high spirituality), intercession (petitions for sinful people), and
thanksgiving (including the liturgy, the Eucharist).</q></p>
<p>I wrote about the authorities at the following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="29072023.html">29072023.html</a></p>
<p>I also wrote earlier: <q>A short example of family life is the prayer
at the Liturgy:</q>that we may live a quiet (without disturbances) and
peaceful (in harmony, love, unanimity, peace and unity) life in all
godliness and purity”. And this is… a request for authorities”.</p>
<p>About <q>salvation and the cognition of the truth</q>:

<br><a class="link2" href="02082023.html">02082023.html</a></p>
<p>Verse 5 should be understood in such a way that Christ is both God
and human  &ndash; He has two natures, and therefore can be the Mediator in the
salvation of people. We must understand that we cannot think of a
<q>middle nature</q> between God’s and man’s, between the uncreated and the
created, because it could not have the qualities of both as its own
ones. Therefore, Christ is not a Being with a <q>middle nature between God
and man</q>. He is called human to emphasise that He is (in addition to
being God, He is also) a perfect human being. Since salvation consists
in the union of human beings with God, the true Mediator unites the two
natures of God and human beings in One Person, One Hypostasis, Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>There is a good article about the Redemption of Jesus Christ here:
<br><a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>
<p>Luke IV:16  &ndash; ‘ημερα’  &ndash; ‘emera’  &ndash; (on the) ‘day’.</p>
<p>Luke IV, 18  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’ ((upon) Me).</p>
<p>Luke IV, 22  &ndash; ‘εμαρτυρουν’  &ndash; ‘emartyroun’  &ndash; ‘testified’  &ndash; from
‘μαρτυρεω’  &ndash; ‘martyreo’.</p>
<p>The Gospel reading is about the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry
in the synagogue in His native Nazareth. <q>The simple greatness in the
fulfilment of prophecy shows us Christ’s simplicity.</q> A quote from the
reading from the prophet Isaiah  &ndash; Isaiah LXI, 1-3. There is also a
similar passage in Isaiah LVIII, 6. I wrote about these chapters in Lent
and after Easter at the following links:

<p><reading>(2 Corinthians XI, 5-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XI, 7, 9  &ndash; ‘εμαυτον’ -
‘emauton’  &ndash; ‘me (myself)’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 11:10  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (in) ‘me’. ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’ -
(of) ‘me’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 11:12, 21  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XI, 13-15  &ndash; the forms of the verb ‘μετασχηματιζω’ -
‘metaschematizo’  &ndash; ‘to change appearance, transfigure, adapt’ are
used.</p>
<p>Paul here boldly dynamically and somewhat impulsively defends his
ministry as an apostle among the Corinthians in particular (and in other
Churches where he preached). He shows that his ministry was sacrificial,
unburdensome, and full of love for the Corinthians, in contrast to the
preaching of the false apostles.</p>
<p>The mention of the arch-apostles (older apostles), i.e. the 12 and
James, the Lord’s brother, suggests that other true apostles preached
and lived with similar virtues.</p>
<p>Paul also warns against reckless self-praise, comparing it to losing
one’s mind (foolish behaviour).</p>

<p>I wrote about the parallel passage in Matthew here:
