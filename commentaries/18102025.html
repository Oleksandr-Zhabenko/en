it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.

<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
To the Apostle and Evangelist Luke, my beloved Saint:<br>
<reading>(Colossians IV, 5-9, 14, 18 ) </reading><br>
Colossians IV, 5 — &#39;Ἐν σοφίᾳ&#39; - &#39;En sophia&#39; - <q>in wisdom; wisely</q>. How.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 6 — &#39;πάντοτε ἐν χάριτι&#39; - &#39;pantote en khariti&#39; - <q>always in grace; always in good; always gracious</q>. That is, benevolent, filled with goodness more than simply humanly. That is, goodness is to be visible also in words.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 7 — &#39;ἐν κυρίῳ&#39; - &#39;en kyrio&#39; - <q>in the Lord</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 8 — &#39;πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο&#39; - &#39;pros hymas eis auto touto&#39; - <q>to you for this very purpose</q>. With what aim. &#39;παρακαλεση&#39; - &#39;parakalean&#39; - <q>comforted, consoled</q>. Related by root to the name of the Holy Spirit — the Comforter.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 9 — &#39;ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; - &#39;ex hymon&#39; - <q>from you</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following &#39;hy&#39; here indicates representation of a certain community, Onesimus here is a representative of the Colossians in Paul&#39;s circle.
</p>
<p>
Colossians IV, 14 — &#39;Λουκᾶς ὁ ἰατρὸς ὁ ἀγαπητὸς&#39; - &#39;Loukas ho iatros ho agapetos&#39; - <q>Luke, the beloved physician</q>. The apostle and evangelist Luke is mentioned, my beloved Saint.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul writes concluding greetings in the letter and writes about his intentions and those of his co-workers with him, among whom Luke is also mentioned, <q>the beloved physician</q> by profession and occupation. It is believed that Luke is so called not only because he treated Paul, helped him, but also because of his devotion, for he did not leave him even at a time when all left earlier (therefore, their friendship was tested).

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke X, 16-21) </reading><br>
Luke X, 17 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου&#39; - &#39;en to onomati sou&#39; - <q>in Thy name; with Thy name</q>. Both translation variants are possible, with the first indicating for what sake demons submit — because the apostles preached, being truly Christ&#39;s disciples, sent by Him, in fact for the sake of authority given by Christ and exercised through His name, and the second — with what the authority received from Christ by the disciples is exercised. The address to Jesus <q>Thou</q> here emphasises that the disciples are gladdened not by authority as such, but by living and life-filled relations with Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 18 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ&#39; - &#39;ek tou ouranou&#39; - <q>from the heaven</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; by meaning here indicates from where the fall of the devil occurred. Emphasises the dramatic nature of the fall from the state of a high angel to the devil.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 20 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; - &#39;en touto&#39; - <q>in this; with this</q>. Both translation variants are possible, with the first indicating the perception of authority over spirits as a state in which the disciples are, and the second — the subject of joy, what gladdens the disciples. &#39;ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς&#39; - &#39;en tois ouranois&#39; - <q>in the heavens</q>. Indicates that the Lord granted glory to each apostle, and more generally — to disciples, in the heavens. The struggle with the evil one will cease in the Kingdom of God, but this glory will last eternally.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 21 — &#39;Ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ&#39; — &#39;En aute te hora&#39; - <q>in that hour</q>. Common expression. &#39;ἐν τῷ πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ&#39; - &#39;en to pneumati to hagio&#39; - <q>in the Holy Spirit; with the Holy Spirit</q>. Both translation variants are possible, the first more indicates being in the Spirit, while the second that the Father sent the Holy Spirit to rejoice Jesus. Here is an indication of the personal relations of the Father, Son and Spirit. &#39;ἀπὸ σοφῶν&#39; - &#39;apo sophon&#39; - <q>from the wise</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here indicates that those wise remained apart, and therefore did not receive from God what would correspond to people&#39;s thought about them.
</p>
<p>
It needs to be said that if a person knows the Son of God with love, by this they are likened to the Father, Who knows and loves the Son, Who sent Him into the world. A person can receive the Son Who like the Father loves Him, they also receive God&#39;s plan regarding the salvation of people and other similar things. And this means that they are like the Father in this, and this is possible only when the Father gives this to them. Therefore one can come to Jesus if the Father draws. See more at the link:<br>

<p>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XV, 58-XVI, 3) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XV, 58 — &#39;ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ τοῦ κυρίου&#39; - &#39;en to ergo tou kyriou&#39; - <q>in the work of the Lord; with the work of the Lord</q>. Both translation variants are possible. &#39;ἐν κυρίῳ&#39; - &#39;en kyrio&#39; - <q>in the Lord</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 1 — &#39;εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους&#39; - &#39;eis tous hagious&#39; - <q>for the saints</q>. Here the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the directedness of action.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 2 — <q>on every first day of the week</q> — that is, every Sunday (according to the Jewish calendar). Sunday — the Lord&#39;s day, when especially the New Testament Church honoured the Lord, first of all through the common celebration of the Eucharist during the Liturgy (compare with Acts XX, 7). It needs to be said that in the text stands a complex linguistic construction, but it is used precisely in such a meaning. &#39;παρ&#39; ἑαυτῷ&#39; - &#39;par heauto&#39; - <q>in the vicinity to himself; near himself</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; in its form before the following vowel here with dative case and means <q>in the vicinity of</q>. Here means specially prepared personal property for sacrifice for help.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 3 — &#39;εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ&#39; - &#39;eis Hierousalem&#39; - <q>to Jerusalem</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul teaches to care for one&#39;s neighbours, especially for brothers and sisters in Christ, and certain types of care to make weekly (and one can say in generalized terms also periodic, at the same time constant), so as not to complicate these matters, to make them simple.
