it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

I prepared an improved version of my research, the presentation of which is available at the link:<br>

<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Timothy I, 1-7) </reading><br>
1 Timothy I, 2 — &#39;τέκνῳ ἐν πίστει&#39; — &#39;tekno en pistei&#39; - <q>to a child in faith</q>. Paul brought Timothy to deeper faith. &#39;χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν&#39; - &#39;kharis, eleos, eirene apo theou patros kai CHristou Iesou tou kyriou hemon&#39; - <q>grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates here that grace, mercy, peace are gifts of God to people.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 3 — &#39;ἐν Ἐφέσῳ&#39; — &#39;en Epheso&#39; - <q>in Ephesus</q>. Where. &#39;εἰς Μακεδονίαν&#39; - &#39;eis Makedonian&#39; - <q>into Macedonia</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 4 — &#39;ἐν πίστει&#39; — &#39;en pistei&#39; - <q>in faith; with faith</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that faith is a good condition of growth in God, and the second — that it also builds.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 5 — &#39;ἀγάπη ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας καὶ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς καὶ πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου&#39; — &#39;agape ek katharas kardias kai syneideseos agathes kai pisteos anypokritou&#39; - <q>love from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and unfeigned faith</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here that the love in question comes from purity of heart, from purification, good conscience and deep faith. See in more detail also at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30112025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/30112025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 6 — &#39;ἐξετράπησαν εἰς ματαιολογίαν&#39; — &#39;exetrapesan eis mataiologian&#39; - <q>turned aside into vain jangling</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the direction where they turned aside, that is, this was not their goal, but they <q>went astray from the road</q> there. A different word is used than that which is used regarding Christ&#39;s teaching about prayer in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew VI. It indicates that this is not simply a certain deficiency, but a substantial characteristic of the life of those people.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the 1st Epistle of the Apostle Paul to Timothy — an apostle from the seventy, one of Paul&#39;s closest co-workers and his disciple. The Epistle is considered pastoral, that is, concerns the ministry of Timothy (and therefore, not only his) as a Church pastor, in particular as an example for bishops.
</p>
<p>
By <q>commandment</q> are called God&#39;s commandments, the short content of which is described here further. As is known, purity of heart is not simply sincerity (includes it as a component), but purification from sins and sinful passions, and purity which is mentioned in the 6th beatitude. A good conscience means constant awareness of good and evil, and also doing and thinking good, and not evil. And sincere faith — that is, not for show (in those times faith was widespread as part of social life, therefore many people could seek the appearance of faith, but not always faith itself), but true faith, God&#39;s faith.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul entrusted Timothy to take care of stopping vain disputes and speculations in Ephesus, where there appeared before that those who tried by vain mental constructions to captivate and attract people&#39;s attention. Paul testifies that those speculations are vain.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIV, 12-15) </reading><br>
Luke XIV, 14 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει&#39; — &#39;en te anastasei&#39; - <q>in the resurrection; with the resurrection</q>. In general, both variants of translation are possible, although the second affirms that the resurrection <q>gives back</q> something to people. More understandable is the first variant, when after the resurrection there will be judgement and the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIV, 15 — &#39;ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;en te basileia tou theou&#39; - <q>in the Kingdom of God</q>. Where and when.
</p>
<p>
A unique transmission of Luke.
</p>
<p>
The same logic is in the work at the link, it is generally characteristic of reasoning in Luke:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The Lord calls to selflessness in doing good.
</p>
<p>
If a person does good, hoping for reward from people, then this expectation makes them a part and participant of completely human relations, in which there is also place for sins and passions, for everything that is also outside the Gospel. And even if a person is not tempted by that, the very expectation already serves for them either as a reason for disappointment, or as a reason for excessive hope in people, or as a reason for uncertainty and worry. In one word, even if a person does not sin directly, they are <q>as if shaken</q> by this uncertainty regarding people.
</p>
<p>
And a person who does good for the Lord&#39;s sake should be certain that they will receive good from God. Indeed, as it is said in another place, such a person <q>will not lose their reward</q>. See at the links:<br>
