<p>
<reading>(Romans I, 1-7, 13-17) </reading><br>
The reading of the Epistles of the Holy Apostles begins and will continue until the next Great Lent. The beginning of the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans.
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 4 &mdash; 'ἡμῶν' - 'emon' - 'us' (our). 
</p>
<p>
Romans I, 7 &mdash; 'εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ'. ' - 'eirene apo theou patros emon kai kyriou iesou christou' - 'peace from (peace as a gift from God, a manifestation of God's truthfulness and love, at the same time connected with the life and faith of the faithful themselves) God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'. The use of the preposition 'apo' indicates God's gift to people. See more about this at the following links:<br>

</p>
<p>
Romans I, 17 &mdash; 'ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται' - 'ek pisteos zesetai' - 'will live by faith'. According to the above, in particular the references, Paul is writing about the <q>origin</q> of the life of the righteous - it is a continuation and manifestation of their faith. He is not saying that faith is the source of life in itself (as some unclear translations might suggest), but that the life of the righteous is the organic continuation and logical consequence of their faith, and at the same time is a movement towards the future fulfilment of faith as the expected Kingdom of God. Faith in these words is the starting point of life, and in the previous ones it is also the point of designation of movement, but already accomplished, that is, to a certain extent achieved and fulfilled. A person who has fulfilled God's will and commandments is righteous, and at the same time their state can be called <q>new faith</q>, in which they have <q>arrived</q> through fulfilment and life. At the beginning of the verse, the same phrase is used.

As for the reading from the Apostle, Paul writes about the apostolic labour, with many challenges but with many fruits, and the holy martyr in her virtuous life and suffering for Christ was likened to that labour.
