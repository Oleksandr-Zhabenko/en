it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(2 Thessalonians I, 1-10) </reading><br>
2 Thessalonians I, 1 — &#39;ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ&#39; — &#39;en theo patri hemon kai kyrio Iesou CHristo&#39; - <q>in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 2 — &#39;ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; — &#39;apo theou patros hemon kai kyriou Iesou CHristou&#39; - <q>from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that grace and peace are gifts of God to people.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 3 — &#39;εἰς ἀλλήλους&#39; — &#39;eis allelous&#39; - <q>towards one another</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 4 — &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν ἐνκαυχᾶσθαι ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; — &#39;en hymin enkaukhasthai en tais ekklesiais tou theou&#39; - <q>glory in you in the Churches of God</q>. By meaning here only such variant of translation.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 5 — &#39;εἰς τὸ καταξιωθῆναι&#39; — &#39;eis to kataxiothenai&#39; - <q>so that to be made worthy</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 6 — &#39;παρὰ θεῷ&#39; — &#39;para theo&#39; - <q>in the vicinity of God; near God</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the dative case, indicates that righteousness brings near to God.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 7 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει&#39; — &#39;en te apokalypsei&#39; - <q>in the revelation</q>. &#39;ἀπ&#39; οὐρανοῦ&#39; - &#39;ap ouranou&#39; - <q>from heaven</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates that Christ will descend from heaven.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 8 — &#39;ἐν πυρὶ φλογός&#39; — &#39;en pyri phlogos&#39; - <q>in flaming fire</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 9 — &#39;ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης&#39; — &#39;apo prosopou tou kyriou kai apo tes doxes&#39; - <q>from the face of the Lord and from the glory</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in both cases here indicates the false cause of perishing. People will perish not from God&#39;s glory and the face of the Lord, but from their unrepentant sins and vices.
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 10 — &#39;ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ&#39; — &#39;en tois agiois autou&#39; - <q>in His saints; with His saints</q>. Since the glory of the saints does not increase the glory of God by essence, the first variant of translation is better. &#39;ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύσασιν&#39; - &#39;en pasin tois pisteusasin&#39; - <q>in all who have believed</q>. Analogously to the previous. &#39;ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ&#39; - &#39;en te hemera ekeine&#39; - <q>in that day</q>.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul after greeting and thanksgiving to God comforts and encourages the Thessalonians in expectation of the Second Coming of Christ and says that it has not yet come (contrary to the opinion of some, who thought otherwise even then, but there are also those who thought so and later, in particular now).
</p>
<p>
Paul writes from the <q>point of view</q> of the Thessalonians themselves, that is, simply expresses to them moral emotional support in sufferings for Christ, not delving into theological and ethical questions. The Thessalonians desired justice, therefore Paul writes about God as the Righteous Judge. The Lord indeed is such, but it is necessary not to forget about God&#39;s mercy and love, which stand higher than judgement.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the expectation of the glorious Second Coming of Jesus Christ the apostle urges the faithful to good and growth in faith and piety.

<reading>(Luke XII, 13-15, 22-31) </reading><br>
Luke XII, 13 — &#39;τις ἐκ τοῦ ὄχλου&#39; — &#39;tis ek tou okhlou&#39; - <q>someone from the crowd</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here from where the man spoke.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 15 — &#39;ἀπὸ πάσης πλεονεξίας&#39; — &#39;apo pases pleonexias&#39; - <q>from all greed</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; emphasises that it is necessary to beware of it in every way and completely. &#39;ἐν τῷ περισσεύειν&#39; - &#39;en to perisseuein&#39; - <q>in abundance</q>. &#39;ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων&#39; - &#39;ek ton hyparkhonton&#39; - <q>from all that one possesses</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates origin. That is, the fullness of life, its content and completeness do not come from property, from possessions. The word order here more appropriately leads to such a translation, although a more common one is that life does not depend on abundance of property.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 25 — &#39;τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;tis de ex hymon&#39; - <q>who then from you</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates choice among a group, and here in general — the representation of this group, that is, the disciples, and more generally — all people.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 27 — &#39;ἐν πάσῃ τῇ δόξῃ&#39; — &#39;en pase te doxe&#39; - <q>in all the glory</q>.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 28 — &#39;ἐν ἀγρῷ&#39; — &#39;en argo&#39; - <q>in the field</q>. Where. &#39;εἰς κλίβανον&#39; - &#39;eis klibanon&#39; - <q>into an oven</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the reading — a unique transmission of Luke — Jesus does not undertake to judge the brothers about the inheritance. Further He teaches what attitude towards property should be so that this division is just and right. If the brother of the one asking had listened to the words of Jesus and there were grounds to share property, he would have shared. But at the same time the request of the brother could have been caused by the desire through the authority of Jesus to gain <q>additional</q> property. In fact, this was an attempt to <q>draw</q> Jesus into that matter to which there was no God&#39;s will, therefore Jesus responds with a question, and further with teaching.
