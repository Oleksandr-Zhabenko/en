it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts V, 21-33) </reading><br>
It is a continuation of the story commented here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02052025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/02052025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 21 — ‘ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον’ - ‘hypo ton orthron’ - ‘at daybreak’. That is, very early in the morning. The preposition <q>hypo</q> is here with an accusative and indicates the time directly preceding the early dawn. &#39;εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν&#39; - <q>eis to hieron</q> - <q>to the temple</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον&#39; - <q>eis to desmoterion</q> - <q>to prison</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 22 — ‘ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ’ - ‘en te phylake’ - ‘in the prison (with the guards)’. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 23 — ‘ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ’ - ‘en pase asphaleia’ - ‘in all certainty; with all security measures; as reliably as possible’. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 25 — <q>ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ</q> - <q>en te phylake</q> - <q>in the prison (with the guards)</q>. Where. See also the commentary on the same expression in Acts V, 18 here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/27042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/27042025.html</a><br>
 &#39;ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ&#39; — &#39;en to hiero&#39; - &#39;in the temple&#39;. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts V, 27 — <q>ἐν τῷ συνεδρίῳ</q> - <q>en to synedrio</q> - <q>in the Sanhedrin</q>. Where.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(John VI, 14-27) </reading><br>
John VI, 14 — ‘εἰς τὸν κόσμον’ - ‘eis ton kosmon’ - ‘into the world; to the world’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 15 — <q>εἰς τὸ ὄρος</q> - <q>eis to oros</q> - <q>to the mountain; onto the mountain</q>. Where to. The mountain is here with the definite article, so that the readers or listeners could understand which mountain was being referred to.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 17, 21, 22, 24 — <q>εἰς πλοῖον</q> - <q>eis ploion</q> - <q>into a boat; to a boat</q>. Where to. &#39;εἰς Καφαρναούμ&#39; - <q>eis Kapharnaoum</q> - <q>into Capernaum; to Capernaum</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 21 — ‘εὐθέως ἐγένετο τὸ πλοῖον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν εἰς ἣν ὑπῆγον’ - ‘eutheos egeneto to ploion epi ten gen eis hen hypegon’ - ‘immediately (at once) the boat was on the land to which they had departed’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates where they went to.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 23 — <q>πλοιάρια ἐκ Τιβεριάδος</q> - <q>ploiaria ek Tiberiados</q> - <q>small boats from Tiberias</q>. The preposition ‘ek’ here can have a double meaning - it can indicate where the boats sailed from, or it can also indicate where the owners of the boats were from, indicating their origin. Both options complement each other, although perhaps only one of them is meant.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 24 — ‘εἰς τὰ πλοιάρια’ - ‘eis ta ploiaria’ - ‘into the small boats’. Where to.
</p>
<p>
John VI, 26 — <q>ἐφάγετε ἐκ τῶν ἄρτων</q> - <q>ephagete ek ton arton</q> - <q>ate of the loaves</q>. See the explanation of the preposition in the parallel passage on the Eucharist (and Christ&#39;s miracle served as an introduction to His preaching about it) 1 Corinthians XI, 28 here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17042025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17042025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John VI, 27 — <q>ἐργάζεσθε μὴ τὴν βρῶσιν τὴν ἀπολλυμένην, ἀλλὰ τὴν βρῶσιν τὴν μένουσαν εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον</q> - &#39;ergazesthe me ten brosin ten apollymenen, alla ten brosin ten menousan eis zoen aionion&#39; - <q>work (in the sense of active activity for one&#39;s own benefit) not with regard to food that perishes (is lost, destroyed), but with regard to food that remains for eternal life</q>. This is a similar idea to the words about the treasures of the heavens. See, for example, the poem here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Iav6ssKOI/">https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Iav6ssKOI/</a><br>
That is, we need to build and organise our activities around the eternal, not the temporary, and around what matters for eternity.
