<p><reading>(1 Corinthians 15:29-38) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:30  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’ -
‘we’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:31  &ndash; ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; ‘day’. ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’ -
‘our’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:37  &ndash; ‘κοκκον’  &ndash; ‘kokkon’  &ndash; ‘grain’.</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s reading on the general resurrection of
the dead, which I wrote about here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="07082023.html">07082023.html</a></p>
<p>The parallel passage, which relates to the conclusion of today’s
reading, is discussed here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="12042023.html">12042023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul here rejects the argument against belief in the general
resurrection, which is based on purely material ideas, by analogy with
inanimate nature  &ndash; inanimate nature does not often (not necessarily)
form highly organised (very ordered) complexes, but the resurrection of
the dead concerns God’s power and the people who are alive in the
resurrection. Thus, the argument that God <q>cannot create new bodies
properly</q> is rejected as false.</p>
<p>Moreover, he shows where unbelief in the general resurrection of the
dead can (and, therefore, in many cases does, as the experience of many
people and entire nations shows) lead to  &ndash; to a wrong attitude to life,
in particular to its bodily manifestations.</p>
<p>Further argumentation and explanation is based on the visibility of
the death of a seed in the ground. When it gets there, it hides from
people’s sight, sprouts, but it looks as if it has disappeared, died,
and then the result of its falling into the ground appears. This
<q>disappearance</q> of the grain from the field of view symbolises human
death in the apostle’s explanation (and in a parallel place in the
Gospel, see the link above). At the same time, the idea that the grain
remains alive is also present in the Scriptures  &ndash; in particular, Jesus
Christ says that <q>For God all people are alive</q>.</p>
<p>We can say that the state of a grain changes in the ground  &ndash; it
disappears from people’s sight, but it sprouts and bears fruit. So also
do death and then resurrection  &ndash; a person does not disappear completely,
but is <q>alive for God</q>, and then at the time of resurrection rises from
the dead in a new body.</p>
<p>This new body has two characteristics  &ndash; <q>according to what God gives</q>
and <q>according to what the human being personally is</q> (the latter means
that it bears the imprint of the human’s personality, character and
peculiarities). We can say that from God a person receives the divine
characteristics of the resurrected body, such as its indestructibility
and eternity, but this body also reflects what a person is personally
(and this mostly depends on him or her).</p>
<p>
(This paragraph was added on 09.08.2023.) <br>
It should be noted that the resurrected human body will not have all of its characteristics, but only those that have meaning. For example, the wounds of Jesus Christ have significance for us even after His Resurrection, at least until the Second Coming. That is why they remained. Yes, we can think that at the very Last General Judgement (also called the Dread Judgement in the Orthodox tradition), bodies will also have those meaningful characteristics that will show the state of a person during his or her earthly life. But after the Judgement, only those characteristics will be preserved that will be important for the whole of eternity  &ndash; as the Lord says: <q>then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of God,</q> meaning that if they did not shine like the sun before then, they will shine afterwards, after the Judgement. It is also possible to think that the wounds of Christ and the martyrs will disappear in the Kingdom of God, since salvation has already been accomplished.

<p><reading>(Matthew XXI, 23-27) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XXI, 25  &ndash; ‘ημιν’  &ndash; ‘emin’  &ndash; (to)
‘us’.</p>
<p>Jesus is showing that the Jews should have realised the error of
their position towards Him, His work and teaching.</p>
<p>But they do not want to think about it, even though they have every
reason to realise it, but their sinful passions prevail over them.</p>
