<reading>(2 Thessalonians III, 6-18) </reading><br>
Concluding the reading of 2 Thessalonians.<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians III, 6, 14, 18 - 'ἡμῶν' - 'emon' - 'us' (our).<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians III, 7, 9 - 'ἡμᾶς' - 'emas' - 'us'.<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians III, 8 - ἡμέρας - 'emeras' - (of) 'day'.<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians III:10 - 'ἦμεν' - 'emen' - 'were'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul again reminds that it is not good to do nothing and go from place to place in search of entertainment. As an example, he gives the apostles themselves, including himself, as an illustration of hard work. <br>
</p>
<p>
The mention of authority implies that the Lord allowed the servants of Christ to live from their ministry (this permission is called here authority). At the same time, Paul was also an example of industriousness for the sake of edification, although he could refer to this permission.<br>
</p>
<p>
If someone did not want to accept the words of the apostles, either orally or in writing, Paul tried to make them understand, first of all by talking to them so that they would understand that it was wrong, and most importantly, in a brotherly (sisterly) way.<br>
</p>
<p>
The letter concludes with a greeting and blessing signed by the Apostle Paul himself (the text of the letter was most likely written down by Silvanus, but possibly by Timothy, the apostles from the 70 (2 Thessalonians I, 1)).<br>
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XIX, 12-28) </reading><br>
Luke XIX, 14 - 'ἐμίσουν' - 'emisoun' - from 'μισεω' - 'miseo' - 'hated'. 'ἡμᾶς' - 'emas' - 'us'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 22 - 'εἰμι' - 'eimi' - (I) 'am'. Used for emphasis.<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 27, 28 - 'ἔμπροσθέν' - 'emprosthen' - 'in front of the face; in front of'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The parable is similar to the parable of the talents in Matthew (Matthew XXV, 14-30), which I wrote about here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24092023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/24092023.html</a><br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Luke gives additional details, including the situation with the townspeople (there is a significant parallel here, in particular, it can also be understood that this is about demons who rebelled against God and will be the first to be judged, who do not want to have anything to do with God in His goodness, while people have some kind of relationship with God, except for enmity).<br>
</p>
<p>
If we understand mines in a broad sense, then it also makes sense that a person can not only have the image of God as a mine, but also become part of the Church, receiving the Sacraments as a kind of mine, and then these at least two mines, if multiplied and bearing fruit, will serve the person for salvation.<br>
