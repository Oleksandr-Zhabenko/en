</p>
<p>Acts XXI, 8  &ndash; εμειναμεν  &ndash; emeinamen  &ndash; <q>remained,
abided, continued</q>  &ndash; from μενω  &ndash; meno  &ndash; <q>to remain, to continue</q>.</p>
<p>Acts XXI, 12  &ndash; ‘παρεκαλουμεν’  &ndash; ‘parekaloumen’  &ndash; here <q>began to
beg</q>.</p>
<p>Paul responds by talking about the loud sobs, weeping and how they
break his heart. He expresses his determination not only to suffer, but
even to die for the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Luke and Paul’s other co-workers committed (entrusted) him and
themselves to the will of God.</p>

<p><br />
John XIV, 27  &ndash; ‘εμην’  &ndash; ‘emen’  &ndash; <q>My</q> (peace) (in Greek ‘peace’ is
feminine). The Lord goes on to say that our hearts should not be
agitated or timid, He speaks of courage. There are two extremes here and
a virtue between them  &ndash; ” agitation, rebellion” and <q>timidity,
fearfulness</q>, and good courage is in between.</p>
<p>John XIV, 30, XV, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7  &ndash; ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (in) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Due to the ending of chapter XIV, some think that chapters XV-XVII
were added to the original text later (by John himself or his
disciples). Nevertheless, there are no real differences between these
chapters and all the others in terms of meaning and style, so their
authenticity is the same as all the others.</p>
<p>John XV, 1, 5  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) ‘am’. It is used for emphasis.
‘γεωργος’  &ndash; ‘georgos’  &ndash; ‘husbandman, farmer’ (from this word in Greek we
have the name ‘George’).</p>
<p>John XV, 5  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (from) ‘Me’.</p>
<p>The image of the vine, the vinedresser, and the branches is very
expressive and eloquent, and I think it does not require any additional
explanation beyond the previous ones.</p>
<p><q>My Father is greater than Me</q> are quite profound words to explain,
and it is generally thought that this means that the Son of God is born
of the Father, Who is the Root of the Godhead in this sense, and also
that these words point to the human nature of Jesus  &ndash; the Father is
greater than human nature, and the words themselves speak of the
glorification of the human nature of Jesus. These words do NOT mean that
the Father is greater than the Son in terms of <q>greater fullness of the
Godhead</q> (no, all Three Hypostases of the Trinity are equal in the
Godhead, It is One for all Three). The difficulty lies in how to
understand the birth of the Son of God from the Father, and in the
second case, how the properties of Jesus’ human nature are taken on by
Him as God. Some of the details of this can be seen in the work here:
