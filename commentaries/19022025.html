it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(1 John III, 21 — IV, 6) </reading><br>
1 John III, 22 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>ap autou</q> - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that it is a gift.
</p>
<p>
1 John III:24, IV:2 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in Him; in him’. ‘ἐν τούτῳ’ - ‘en touto’ - ‘in that; by that’. ‘ἐν ἡμῖν’ - ‘en hemin’ - ‘in us’. ‘ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος’ - ‘ek tou pneumatos’ - ‘from the Spirit (the Holy One)’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates the source of this knowledge - the Holy Spirit as a gift from God shows that this is true, that it is the truth.
</p>
<p>
1 John IV, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that it is about whether these spirits are acting from God or whether God has sent them to act. 
</p>
<p>
1 John IV:2 &mdash; ‘ἐν σαρκὶ’ - ‘en sarki’ - ‘in the flesh’. That is, by taking on our weaknesses. ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that it speaks of the Source, that it is the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit. With regard to the origin in the Godhead, the Holy Spirit is spoken of as ‘para tou patros’, and the birth of the Son of God from the Father is spoken of as ‘ek tou patros’, so there is a parallel here for the Holy Spirit&hellip; with the Son. However, the context indicates that the possibility of receiving the Holy Spirit as a gift and knowing God through it is directly related to the Incarnate Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

<p>
1 John IV, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. Similar to verse 1 here. ‘ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ’ - ‘en to kosmo’ - ‘in the world’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John IV, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. It means that God made the faithful like this, gave them this way of life and eternal life. ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ - ‘en hymin’ - ‘in you’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John IV, 5 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου’ - ‘ek tou kosmou’ - ‘from the world’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that the lives of these people are filled with things that can only be seen in creation and not in God, i.e., that life is distant from God.
</p>
<p>
1 John IV, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. Similar to verse 4, and then further on in the passage to verse 1. ‘ἐκ τούτου’ - ‘ek touto’ - ‘from that’. 
</p>

<reading>(Марка XIV, 43 — XV, 1) </reading><br>
Mark XIV, 43 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ τῶν γραμματέων καὶ πρεσβυτέρων’ - ‘para ton arkhiereon kai ton grammateon kai presbyteron’ - ‘from beside the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders’. The preposition ‘para’ is with the genitive case here, indicating that these people were closely connected to the elders of the people. A similar construction is used for the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, and for the human nature of Christ, here indicating the closeness of these people and the fact that they were fully on the side of the elders, supporting the decision to judge Jesus.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 49 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ’ - ‘en to hiero’ - ‘in the temple’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 54 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ μακρόθεν’ - ‘apo makrothen’ - ‘from afar; separately at a distance (as a completely stranger and uninvolved)’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that Peter tried to conceal his apostleship in every way possible. ‘εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν’ - ‘eis ten aulen’ - ‘into the courtyard’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 55 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν’ - ‘eis to thanatosai auton’ - ‘in order to put to death’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 60 &mdash; ‘εἰς μέσον’ - ‘eis meson’ - ‘in the middle; in the midst’ (where to). A common expression.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 62 &mdash; ‘ἐκ δεξιῶν’ - ‘ek dexion’ - ’from the right hand’. That is, in the most honourable place.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 66 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ’ - ‘en te aule’ - ‘in the courtyard’.
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 68 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ προαύλιον’ - ‘eis to proaulion’ - ‘into the porch’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 69, 70 &mdash; ‘ἐξ αὐτῶν’ - ‘ex auton’ - ‘of them’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that Peter is one of them (Jesus' disciples).
</p>
<p>
Mark XIV, 72 &mdash; ‘ἐκ δευτέρου’ - ‘ek deuterou’ - ‘the second time’. A common expression.
