<p><reading>(1 Corinthians XV, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>The continuation of today’s reading was read
earlier and discussed here:
<br>
<a class="link2" href="07082023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">07082023.html</a></p>
<p>1 Corinthians XV, 3  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (‘through’ ours).</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XV, 4  &ndash; ‘ημερα’  &ndash; ‘emera’  &ndash; (on the third) ‘day’.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians XV, 9, 10  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; (I) <q>am</q>. It is used for
emphasis. ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; (to) ‘me’. ‘εμοι’  &ndash; ‘emoi’  &ndash; (to) ‘me’ ((with)
me).</p>
<p>The beginning of the reading is primarily concerned with the
continuation of the reading. If Christians did not keep the Gospel, the
faith as it was received, then they would not have true faith, and then
untrue faith would not be worthy of the attitude that true faith in
Christ should have.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to briefly remind the Corinthians of the Resurrection of
Jesus Christ and His manifestations to the disciples. Many of these
manifestations are not described in the Gospels, so this testimony is
important for understanding that Christ revealed more than the Gospels
describe, and these words complement the Gospels in this regard.</p>
<p>Some people try to deny the truth of the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ, relying on various assumptions to explain the events. But all of
these assumptions do not stand up to scrutiny in light of all the
available evidence. The women and the apostles, who were not waiting for
the Resurrection, saw and talked to Jesus. He ate food; Thomas, who
wanted to be sure, received confirmation; Jesus appeared in different
circumstances to different people, including those who were not ready
and even hostile to Him (Paul himself was a persecutor, but converted
after the miraculous manifestation of the Risen Jesus). The belief of
people that the dead do not rise again was confronted with the clear
fact of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. A fact that had
been foretold long before by the prophets, who had also witnessed other
miracles.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to speak of the work of God’s grace on himself, of his
vocation and further work, of co-operation with God’s grace.</p>
<p><q>prematurely born</q>  &ndash; in the time of the apostles there was no modern
natal medicine, so children born prematurely were smaller, weaker, and
often sickly, with various disorders. Therefore, Paul, humbly comparing
himself to the other witnesses, speaks of himself as if he were inferior
to them.</p>
<p><q>It is not I, but grace…</q> does not deny Paul’s conscious, purposeful,
and persistent work, but emphasises the strengthening, guidance,
encouragement, giving, fulfilment, help, blessing, and so on, all of
which the Lord gave Paul in the course of his cooperation with
grace.</p>

<p><q>Whether I, or they, we…</q>  &ndash; that is, all the apostles and witnesses
of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XIX, 16-26) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XIX, 26  &ndash; ‘εμβλεψας’  &ndash; ‘emblepsas’ -
‘looked into, looked upon’.</p>
<p>It is a well-known story about a rich young man. It has many good
explanations, and I will focus only on a few points, some of which I
have written about before.</p>
<p>Regarding the words, <q>No one is good but God</q>, it is believed that
Christ is indirectly asking the young man about his faith in Him (<q>Do
you believe that I am God?</q>).</p>
<p>I will start from the end. Jesus’ answer to the disciples’ question
shows that the disciples did not understand the significance of God’s
grace in the salvation of people. They thought that a person is saved…
by their own righteousness. Moreover, in the Old Testament, wealth is
linked to righteousness, for the Lord blesses those who keep the
commandments. But actually, righteousness itself, if it is real, has its
origin in the work of God’s grace, and the cooperation of the person
themselves. As it is written in the references above, God always begins
the First. He is <q>the Alpha (Beginning) and the Omega (Goal, Purpose)</q>,
as the Revelation of John the Theologian says.</p>
<p>Human beings cannot be saved by their own efforts; salvation is
always a gift from God. I have written about this before, mainly when
considering the letters of the Apostle Paul, who writes a lot about it.
Nevertheless, one needs to accept this gift and co-operate with God in
the work of salvation. Everything is possible for God.</p>
<p>The story of the young man shows us some of the difficulties that
come with trying to achieve salvation in one’s own strength. In the end,
the young man had difficulty deciding whether to follow Christ. And he
went away grieving.</p>
<p>I have written before that <q>the young man put his hope in riches</q>
(another evangelist says this in a parallel place). <q>Putting one’s hope
in something</q> here means putting that at the centre of one’s life. Where
the Lord should be.</p>
<p><q>To come into the Kingdom of God</q> means to live consciously in this
life in accordance with God’s will and calling. <q>Cannot come in</q> means
that they do not have the strength and ability to live this way, which
is clearly seen in the example of the young man.</p>
<p>And one more thing  &ndash; Christ called the young man to perfection
through voluntary sacrificial poverty. The young man was overly attached
to wealth, so Christ directly tells him to give away his wealth for the
sake of the heavenly treasure as the way to perfection. See also more
about heavenly treasures:
