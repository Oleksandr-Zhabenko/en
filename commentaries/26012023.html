<p>Christ Was Baptized!

<p><reading>(Mark XI, 27-33) </reading>
</p>

<p>The Gospel was read today about the authority of Jesus and the baptism of John. I wrote a few days ago, see the entry on January 12, 2023 on my Facebook page (</p>
<p><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0YMrMnxjeaAWeJQdHWKnzuGJBPiojDBCRvzKprxDWFSSPpg2XgQRLWHnoVz44TQmBl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0YMrMnxjeaAWeJQdHWKnzuGJBPiojDBCRvzKprxDWFSSPpg2XgQRLWHnoVz44TQmBl</a></p>
<p>).</p>

<p><reading>(James IV, 7  &ndash;  V, 9) </reading>
</p>

<p>A voluminous passage was read from the Apostle, which consists of several parts, which basically encourage us to implement what Jacob wrote about before (we analyzed it recently).</p>
<p>Each of the parts is deep and needs separate works, due to lack of space I will stop at only 2 places.</p>
<p>1) <q>Now you, listen!</q> â€” in the original â€” <q>Come and listen!</q>. The apostle writes like the prophets.</p>
<p>2) James 4:11-12  &ndash; seems illogical at first glance: the Law of Moses spells out what is sin, and if it is used to expose sin, then it is used as intended. But then why does such person <q>judge the Law</q>, <q>is the judge, not the doer</q>? I will highlight two reasons (you also need to take into account what was written on January 13, 2023 on my Facebook page here </p>
<p><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02wx2z6mA1kZ71sie5GvVUmNgzLh5i8bVRQXygQyps9Nyr6458k4wsXrd8XzbQMBL4l">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02wx2z6mA1kZ71sie5GvVUmNgzLh5i8bVRQXygQyps9Nyr6458k4wsXrd8XzbQMBL4l</a></p>
<p>):</p>
<p>a) The law is designed to judge sin, not people, that is, it provides not only judgment for sinners, but also protection. Therefore, a person who considers the Law only as a list of <q>possible violations and punishments</q> (like the Criminal code) and judging his / her neighbour, such a person easily violates the protective part of the Law due to his / her weakness and sinfulness. Therefore, <q>judges the Law.</q></p>
<p>b) <q>doer of the Law</q> â€” used derivative of the word <q>to create</q> (like writing poems); <q>performer</q> therefore implies a creative approach to the Law, not just a mechanical literal performance, but a creative process, such as performing a song, reciting and writing poetry or music, etc. Fulfilling the Law (similarly also the Gospel) means creatively (poetically) fulfilling it in one's own life and in the lives of others. Does not <q>fulfill</q> the Law (Gospel) (does not create the Law (Gospel)) and a person who does not have this co-creation with God. A person who judges his neighbors as a judge <q>on the basis of the Law</q> does not have full creative cooperation with God, who wants to save people. And this partiality, according to the beginning of the 2nd chapter of the message, is a violation of everything.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
