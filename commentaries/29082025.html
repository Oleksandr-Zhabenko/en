it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

<reading>(Mark VI, 14-30) </reading><br>
Mark VI, 14 — 'ἐγήγερται ἐκ νεκρῶν' - 'egegertai ek nekron' - <q>has risen from the dead</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here from where the transition occurred, in Herod's opinion — from the dead to the living. 'ἐν αὐτῷ' - 'en auto' - <q>by Him</q>. Herod thought that Jesus is an <q>instrument of miracles</q>, that is He does not work them, but they <q>happen</q>, using His (imaginary John the Baptist's) resurrection. Of course, the thought is far from reality.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 17 — 'ἐν φυλακῇ' - 'en phylake' - <q>in prison</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 28 — 'ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ' - 'en te phylake' - <q>in the prison</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 29 — 'ἐν μνημείῳ' - 'en mnemeio' - <q>in a tomb</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
The history of the martyrdom of Saint John the Baptist. Mark, as sometimes happens, gives the most details among all the evangelists.
</p>
<p>
I shall add that Jesus was considered to be Elijah, for before the Messiah according to Old Testament prophecies Elijah had to come (which was precisely John the Baptist in spirit and power as the Forerunner of the First Coming of Christ, and Elijah himself personally as the herald of the Second Coming of Christ, at least regarding the latter such opinion is widespread). Similarly there was a opinion that the prophet Jeremiah hid the ark of the covenant, and before the Coming of Christ he will also appear to indicate where the ark is located. Thus regarding two prophets such thoughts were widespread, therefore also regarding others simple people thought that also with them there can be something similar.
</p>
<p>
The evangelist Mark emphasises that Herod even at times acted according to John's words, although he kept him in prison, and finally executed him. An example of what can happen to a person who does not try to live according to the voice of their conscience or the demands of morality.
</p>
<p>
Later, when this same Herod judged Jesus Christ, then Jesus, unlike the trial before Pontius Pilate, answered nothing to Herod. It is considered, because that one would take nothing good for himself from those answers, so spiritually fallen was he.
</p>
<p>
There is a thought that the Lord allowed John to suffer before the Resurrection of Jesus, so that he would preach also in Hades about the soon liberation of Old Testament righteous ones, so strong were John's words. The Lord Jesus Christ, having risen, freed also John from Hades with Himself to Paradise.
