<p>The readings for today combine two consecutive daily readings for
today and tomorrow’s feast day. <br>
<reading>(Romans XV, 17-29; Romans XVI, 1-16) </reading><br>
Romans XV, 18, XVI, 2, 7, 13  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; ‘me’.</p>
<p>Romans 15:20  &ndash; ‘θεμελιον’  &ndash; ‘themelion’  &ndash; (on) ‘the cornerstone, the
foundation’.</p>
<p>Romans 15:24  &ndash; ‘εμπλησθο’  &ndash; ‘emplestho’  &ndash; ‘would satisfy, would be
filled’.</p>
<p>Romans 15:27  &ndash; ‘εκοινωνησαν’  &ndash; ‘ekoinonesan’  &ndash; ‘divided, shared, had
fellowship’. ‘λειτουργισαι’  &ndash; ‘leitourgesai’  &ndash; ‘to have a common cause,
to act together’ (hence the word ‘liturgy’).</p>
<p>In chapter XV, Paul speaks about his ministry and plans for the
future (it is not known whether Paul was in Spain, there is no evidence
to suggest that he was). It is noteworthy that the Christian community
is not just a spiritual association, but also takes an active part in
the material needs of the faithful and different people.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, Paul concludes his letter with personal
greetings to the chosen Christians, many of whom are saints (most of
them in the number of 70 apostles).</p>
<p>A <q>holy kiss</q> is one that does not cause sinful temptations or
passions. See here:

<p><reading>(Matthew XII, 46  &ndash; XIII, 3; Matthew XIII, 3-9, are read together to the end of chapter XII  &ndash; beginning of chapter XIII)</reading> <br>
Matthew XIII, 2  &ndash; ‘εμβαντα’
- ‘embanta’  &ndash; ‘having entered’ ((into) the boat).</p>
<p>A passage about who is really close to Jesus, as well as the parable
of the sower without explanation.</p>
<p>It is a great gift from God to be a relative of Jesus, or to know Him
closely, as He Himself says: <q>Blessed are you who see</q>  &ndash; what the
prophets, the righteous and kings wanted to see, but did not.
Nevertheless, the most important thing is to fulfil God’s will. This is
what unites us with Christ better than bodily ties.</p>
<p>There are good reflections on the parable itself at the following
link (I must say that they allow us to look at many topical issues in a
new way, including the management of time):
