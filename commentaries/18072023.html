<p>Paul goes on to speak about marriage, spouses and related matters. He
makes a clear distinction between the Lordâ€™s commandment and his own
advice. Nevertheless, believers, the Church sees in the apostleâ€™s words
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and therefore also generally accepts
this advice as Godâ€™s will.</p>
<p>It is important to note, as I wrote earlier, that Paul could not
refer to Christâ€™s words in this matter whenever he says <q>from himself</q>.
This is only possible in two cases: either Christ did not say anything
about it, or He did, but Paul did not know about it. In the second case,
doubts arise about the authority of the Apostle Paulâ€™s teaching in
general, and I believe this option is false. Therefore, Christ did not
say anything on this subject. But He did say something, which is
described in the Gospels. Christâ€™s silence on such a vital and important
topic is quite significant. It must be said that the Lord said that <q>I
still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now</q>
(John XVI, 12). It is also possible to think that the perception and
understanding of the faithful in different times will be somewhat
different, so the Lord Jesus Christ said on this subject only what is
unchanging and fundamental  &ndash; until the time of His Second Coming. See,
in particular:

<p>1 Corinthians VII, 5  &ndash; â€˜ÏƒÏ…Î¼Ï†Ï‰Î½Î¿Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜symphonosâ€™  &ndash; <q>symphonic,
consonant, sounding alike together; conveys by means of a musical image
the concept of agreement, unanimity</q>.</p>
<p>As for temptation, the verse speaks of <q>lack of self-control,</q> that
is, the virtue of temperance, that is, the ability to completely and
easily control oneâ€™s desires and urges. The evil one can, with Godâ€™s
permission, tempt people in marriage to adultery if they lack this
particular virtue of temperance. How to acquire this virtue well in this
matter is well described here:

<p>1 Corinthians VII, 7  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautonâ€™  &ndash; â€˜myselfâ€™.</p>
<p>I would also add that the Old Testament also has a lot to say about
marriage, see, for example:

<p><reading>(Matthew XIV, 1-13) </reading>

<p>The story of the imprisonment and martyrdom of
Saint John the Baptist. It is commemorated on the Day of the event
itself (commemorated on August 29 (September 11)). Johnâ€™s reproach was
righteous  &ndash; Herod had indeed sinned by taking Herodias as his wife. In
another Gospel about John and Herod, it is said that not only people
considered John a prophet, but also Herod himself. Nevertheless, sin
took hold of Herod and he disobeyed the voice of the prophet, and even
imprisoned him.</p>
<p>Herodias hated John because he had exposed her sin and wanted him
dead.</p>
<p>Herod wrongly made an oath (see, for example, Jesusâ€™ words about
<br>
<a class="link2" href="09062023.html">09062023.html</a><br> ). Herod
could have done better to break his oath than to have John the Baptist
killed. But even here he disobeyed Godâ€™s will and sinned gravely along
with Herodias and her daughter.</p>
<p>Jesusâ€™ sadness is evident in His seclusion. This reaction is
consistent with the situation when, as the saying goes, <q>there are
simply no wordsâ€¦</q>. Jesus goes into seclusion to set an example for us so
that people do not sin in such situations with words and deeds.</p>
