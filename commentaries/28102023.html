<p>Since today is the feast day of three great saints, there are three
possible types of worship services in honour of these saints. Therefore,
only one of the following three readings is chosen, and I am providing
all three.</p>
<p>To Saint Job, hegumen of Pochaev: (Galatians V, 22  &ndash; VI, 2; Luke VI,
17-23) For more information about these frequent readings to the
reverend saints, see the following links:

<p>Daily readings: (2 Corinthians III, 12-18) Continuation of the
reading referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid032ySY4s1GWRHA5TAvuaBJ28nv26EcYQLyG6m4jdcEuw7NQfoEwVAMtbqF7wCutkBl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid032ySY4s1GWRHA5TAvuaBJ28nv26EcYQLyG6m4jdcEuw7NQfoEwVAMtbqF7wCutkBl</a><br></p>
<p>2 Corinthians III:14  &ndash; ‘ημερας’  &ndash; ‘emeras’  &ndash; (to this) ‘day’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III, 17  &ndash; ‘ελευθερια’  &ndash; ‘eleutheria’  &ndash; ‘freedom,
liberty’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians III:18  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>Paul describes the experience of the New Testament in a very
figurative and profound way in comparison with the Old Testament Moses
and the Israelites. Moses hid his glory because his body was old (he was
80-120 years old, although he retained strength of body and complete
clarity of mind) and also because he did not want the Israelites to see
him as a deity. Paul had previously written that the Old Testament had
glory, but it was passing away, whereas the New Testament is one that
will last. And here he explains how this glory of the New Testament, of
God’s redemption and salvation, glorification, and so on, through the
co-operation of the believers with God in Christ, in the Holy Spirit,
how this glory transforms the believers  &ndash; <q>from glory to glory</q>  &ndash; that
is, it does not fade, does not stop, but continues and grows.</p>
<p>The need to wait for Christ is figuratively called a <q>veil</q>. As long
as a person waits for Christ as someone who is not already Christ’s,
waiting as a ‘stranger’, they are still wearing this ‘veil’. But as soon
as they become Christ’s, become <q>His</q>, the <q>veil</q> is removed, giving way
to the <q>open face</q> of union with Christ and co-transfiguration with Him
in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In fact, all of this means that the Lord Jesus Christ, in Whose image
all people are created, seeks to transfigure people in salvation so as
to remove this veil, this <q>obstacle</q> of <q>only expectation</q> and not
reality itself, so that we may know Him <q>face to face</q>, openly, freely
and boldly.</p>
