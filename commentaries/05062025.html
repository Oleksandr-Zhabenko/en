it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts XXV, 13-19) </reading><br>
Acts XXV, 13 — 'εἰς Καισάριαν' - 'eis Kaisarian' - <q>to Caesarea</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXV, 14 — 'ἀνήρ τίς ἐστιν καταλελειμμένος ὑπὸ Φήλικος δέσμιος' - 'aner tis estin kataleleimmenos hypo Phelikos desmios' - <q>there is a certain man left by Felix as a prisoner</q>. The preposition 'hypo' here is with the genitive case and indicates the passive voice of the participle <q>left</q>.
</p>
<p>
Acts XXV, 15 — 'γενομένου μου εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα' - 'genomenou mou eis Hierosolyma' - <q>when I came to Jerusalem</q>. Where to. This translation option makes sense here. The preposition 'eis' indicates here that Festus had recently (before the described by him events have taken their place) become the governor in Jerusalem, having been transferred there shortly before the events he mentions.
