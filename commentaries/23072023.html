<p><reading>(Romans 15:1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans 15:3  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘Me’.</p>
<p>Romans XV:4, 5  &ndash; ‘παρακλησεως’  &ndash; ‘parakleseos’  &ndash; ‘comfort,
encouragement, consolation, giving willingness and courage’. Hence the
name of the Holy Spirit  &ndash; the Comforter.</p>
<p>Romans XV, 6  &ndash; <q>with one accord (unanimously) and with one mouth</q> -
an important detail  &ndash; ‘unanimously’ is one word in the original Greek,
and ‘with one mouth’ is two (three together with the preposition). This
means that the culture of the Gentiles of that time (the Greeks, the
Hellenistic culture) had a clear idea of unanimity as a state, as a
phenomenon, as an event, so there was a separate compound word for the
concept. But there was no established concept for <q>one mouth</q>  &ndash; it was
something new. Indeed, if an non-believer repeats something, they try to
<q>retell it in their own words</q>, or even look for a way to be original in
their words. But Paul is saying something else  &ndash; if the believers in
Christ have the same faith, they can formulate it in the same words, and
this formulation is good, it testifies to this unity, which is deeper
than just a single-mindedness and unanimity.</p>
<p>Paul writes that Christ, being God, served and serves people for
their salvation. By this service He <q>received men into the glory of
God</q>. God serves people! This is the glory of God!</p>
<p>And in this way Christ is the Example and Model for the faithful and
for all in this. So, if a person is capable of something (in a very
broad sense, good, strong, intelligent, rich, influential, etc.), then
they can and are called to serve for the salvation of others, being like
Christ Himself.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IX, 27-35) </reading>
</p>
<p>The healing of two blind men and a
demon-possessed man, as well as a summary of the preaching and curing,
and the ministry of Jesus Christ in general.</p>
<p>I wrote once before that the prayer of the blind is the first Jesus
prayer, known in various versions. For example, a widely used version of
the Lord’s Prayer is <q>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us!</q>
If we compare the prayer of the blind men and Jesus’ prayer, and
remember that <q>Son of David</q> is a synonym for <q>Messiah</q> in the Old
Testament faith, which in Greek is <q>Christ</q>, the parallel becomes direct
and obvious. Thus, the Jesus prayer is the prayer of the healed blind
men in the Gospels, combined with Peter’s confession.</p>
<p>Jesus strictly forbade the healed blind men to tell at that time, but
they told everywhere anyway. The general consensus is that the
prohibition to tell was intended to prevent people from believing only
because of miracles, from building their faith on miracles. I wrote
about this recently:
