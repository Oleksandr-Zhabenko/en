Romans XII, 6 — 'εἴτε προφητείαν, κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν τῆς πίστεως' - 'eite propheteian kata ten analogian tes pisteos' - if prophecy, according to the measure of the faith. An important detail — the word measure, not just faith. Its addition should change the meaning of what is said, otherwise there would be no sense in adding some additional word to the common expression according to the faith. It is about prophecies from contemporary Christians (regarding the addressees of the Epistle, but in view of God's Word — for contemporary to those who read, as well as previous ones). This is not about recognised Old Testament prophets and not about John the Baptist. That is, we are talking about private revelations, manifestations and attitudes towards them. Paul's words do not reject them, but encourage accepting them in measure of the grace of faith. That is, if some revelation, prophecy can be seen in it the obvious action of grace, then it should be accepted for this reason and trusted to that extent. If there is no obvious action of grace, then there is no need to trust. In any case, such revelations should not contradict faith itself, should not contradict Christ, which should be accepted entirely, completely, not in measure, but unconditionally."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Romans XII, 6-14) </reading><br>
Romans XII, 6 — 'εἴτε προφητείαν, κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν τῆς πίστεως' - 'eite propheteian kata ten analogian tes pisteos' - <q>if prophecy, according to the measure of the faith</q>. An important detail — the word <q>measure</q>, not just faith. Its addition should change the meaning of what is said, otherwise there would be no sense in adding some additional word to the common expression <q>according to the faith</q>. It is about prophecies from contemporary Christians (regarding the addressees of the Epistle, but in view of God's Word — for contemporary to those who read, as well as previous ones). This is not about recognised Old Testament prophets and not about John the Baptist. That is, we are talking about <q>private revelations, manifestations</q> and attitudes towards them. Paul's words do not reject them, but encourage <q>accepting them in measure of the grace of faith</q>. That is, if some revelation, prophecy can be seen in it the obvious action of grace, then it should be accepted for this reason and trusted to that extent. If there is no obvious action of grace, then there is no need to trust. In any case, such revelations should not contradict faith itself, should not contradict Christ, which should be accepted entirely, completely, not <q>in measure</q>, but unconditionally.

<p>
Romans XII, 7 — 'ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ' - 'en te diakonia' - <q>in the ministry</q>. 'ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ' - 'en te didaskalia' - <q>in the teaching</q>. In which activity.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 8 — 'ἐν τῇ παρακλήσει' - 'en te paraklesei' - <q>in the comforting</q>. 'ἐν ἁπλότητι' - 'en haploteti' - <q>in simplicity, sincerity, purity</q>. 'ἐν σπουδῇ' - 'en spoude' - <q>in diligence</q>., 'ἐν ἱλαρότητι' - 'en hilaroteti' - <q>in friendliness, in cheerfulness</q>. These two verses emphasise the constancy of the indicated qualities and states, <q>as if at home</q>, their organicity for those types of service and activity.
</p>
<p>
Romans XII, 10 — 'εἰς ἀλλήλους' - 'eis allelous' - <q>one to another</q>. Here the direction and <q>mobility</q> of love is emphasised — the motivating force of love to actions.
</p>
<p>
I wrote some commentaries earlier, I quote:<br>
<q>The Apostle teaches how to interact with God's gifts.
</p>
<p>
I will dwell on one phrase from the first — </q>he who gives — in simplicity (sincerely, with one heart, not double-minded)<q> (Romans XII, 8).
</p>
<p>
It is important to remember that sin often does not want to retreat, and even good deeds, thoughts, feelings tries to </q>use<q> for itself. Therefore it is good to give, as the Lord through Paul's lips testifies, but the extraordinary need of Christian giving is with the whole heart, not double-minded, sincerely, selflessly. Just as Christian leadership is true leadership, which inspires and gives encouragement (see there)</q>.

<reading>(Matthew IX, 1-8) </reading><br>
Matthew IX, 1 — 'εἰς πλοῖον' - 'eis ploion' - <q>into a boat</q> (to a boat). It is meant <q>some boat</q>, possibly, someone not from His closer disciples invited Him. 'εἰς τὴν ἰδίαν πόλιν' - 'eis ten idian polin' - <q>to His own (native) city</q>.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 3 — 'ἐν ἑαυτοῖς' - 'en heautois' - <q>within themselves</q>. Where. It is about internal speech (in thoughts, silently) (see also verse 4).
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 4 — 'ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις' - 'en tais kardiais' - <q>in hearts</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew IX, 6, 7 — 'εἰς τὸν οἶκόν' - 'eis ton oikon' - <q>to the house</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
The healing of the paralysed man by the faith of companions, also forgiveness of sins. Here the Lord forgives sins — by the faith of companions (neighbours) for God's glory and as testimony about Himself and about God. That is, the visible purpose of this is also God's glory.
</p>
<p>
We often are accustomed to see in forgiveness of sins first of all God's mercy and love, but in Scripture we can meet forgiveness of sins as a manifestation of God's righteousness (justice) (see:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0BJ8SEbWQtcz6YspNHAcG4GUyArottEzDUcgbqT5dqCjuW9Us1p3kLubjxBkz7uFXl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/</a><br>
), and here — God's glory. But these reasons do not deny God's love and mercy either, they presuppose them.
</p>
<p>
It is also important to note that forgiveness of sins occurred by the faith of other people.
