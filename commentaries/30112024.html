it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
To the Apostle Andrew:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians IV, 9-16; John I, 35-51) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians IV, 10, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν (γὰρ) Χριστῷ’ - ‘en (gar) CHristo’ - ‘(because) in Christ; with Christ’. The first translation is more likely, as it is clearer.
</p>
<p>
John I, 35 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν’ - ‘ek ton matheton’ - ‘of the disciples’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates a choice among several people.
</p>
<p>
John I, 40 (39) &mdash; ‘παρ’ αὐτῷ' - <q>par auto</q> - <q>in the vicinity of Him; near Him</q>. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the following vowel here is with the dative case, indicating that they were near Jesus.
</p>
<p>
John I, 41 (40) &mdash; ‘εἷς ἐκ τῶν δύο’ - ‘eis ek ton dyo’ - ‘one of the two’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates a choice from a group of people. ‘παρὰ Ἰωάννου’ - ‘para Ioannou’ - ‘from beside John’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case, the same construction used for the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, and for the human nature of Jesus Christ, which indicates that John's words were from the Holy Spirit, divinely inspired, true.
</p>
<p>
John I, 44 (43) &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν’ - ‘eis ten Galilaian’ - ’into Galilee’. 
</p>
<p>
John I, 45 (44) &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ Βηθσαϊδά, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως’ - ‘apo Bethsaida, ek tes poleos’ - ‘from Bethsaida, from the city’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Philip did not live in Bethsaida (he moved from there), and the preposition ‘ek’ indicates that he came from there, in particular, his relatives were there.
</p>
<p>
John I, 46 (45) &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ νόμῳ’ - ‘en to nomo’ - ‘in the Law’. ‘ἀπὸ Ναζαρέτ’ - ‘apo Nazaret’ - ‘from Nazareth’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Jesus no longer lived in Nazareth, He left it.
</p>
<p>
John I, 47 (46) &mdash; ‘ἐκ Ναζαρὲτ’ - ‘ek Nazaret’ - ‘from Nazareth’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates origin.
</p>
<p>
John I, 48 (47) &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in whom’. 
</p>
<p>
John I, 49 (48) &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τὴν συκῆν’ - ‘ypo ten syken’ - ‘under the fig tree’. The preposition ‘ypo’ here is with the accusative, it indicates location.

<reading>(2 Corinthians VIII, 1-5) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians VIII, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις’ - ‘en tais ekklesiais’ - ‘in the Churches’. The implication is that being in the Church, being a part of the Church, is important for receiving God's grace.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν πολλῇ δοκιμῇ θλίψεως’ - ‘en polle dokime thlipseos’ - ‘in the much experience of tribulation; in the much experience of oppression; in the midst of trials by tribulations’. Different translations are possible, but in general the idea is clear. ‘εἰς τὸ πλοῦτος’ - ‘eis to ploutos’ - ‘into riches; unto riches; with riches’. Grammatically, it is literally the first or the second. More likely the second, since it refers to ‘being enriched even unto riches’.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 3 &mdash; ‘παρὰ δύναμιν’ - ‘para dynamin’ - ‘to proximity with power; on account of power’. More likely the second, i.e., in general, it means that they asked very strongly, perhaps insisted.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians VIII, 4 &mdash; ‘τῆς εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους’ - ‘tes eis tous agious’ - ‘that which is for the saints’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates the direction of the service, for whom it is.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XII, 32-40) </reading><br>
Luke XII, 33 &mdash; ‘ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς’ - ‘en tois ouranois’ - ‘in the heavens’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 36 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῶν γάμων’ - ‘ek ton gamon’ - ‘from the wedding’. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where he will return from.
</p>
<p>
Luke XII, 38 &mdash; ‘κἂν ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ, κἂν ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ φυλακῇ’ - ‘kan en te deutera, kan en te trite phylake’ - ‘and if at the second and if at the third watch’. The preposition ‘en’ is used here in common expressions.
