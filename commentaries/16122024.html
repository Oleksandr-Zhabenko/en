it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(1 Timothy I, 1-7) </reading><br>
1 Timothy I, 2 &mdash; ‘τέκνῳ ἐν πίστει’ - ‘tekno en pistei’ - ‘to a child in the faith; to a child by faith’. The meaning should be the latter. ‘χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς’ - ‘kharis, eleos, eirene apo theou patros’ - ‘grace, mercy, peace from God the Father’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates here that grace, mercy, and peace are God's gifts to people.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν Ἐφέσῳ’ - ‘en Epheso’ - ‘in Ephesus’. ‘εἰς Μακεδονίαν’ - ‘eis Makedonian’ - ‘to Macedonia’.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 4 &mdash; ‘ἐν πίστει’ - ‘en pistei’ - ‘in faith; with faith’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that faith is a good condition for growth in God, and the second that it also builds.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 5 &mdash; ‘ἀγάπη ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας’ - ‘agape ek katharas kardias’ - ‘love from a pure heart’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that the love in question comes from purity of heart, from cleansing.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy I, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐξετράπησαν εἰς ματαιολογίαν’ - ‘exetrapesan eis mataiologian’ - ‘have gone astray into idle talk’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction they went, i.e., it was not their goal, but they ‘lost their way’ there.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark IX, 42-X, 1) </reading><br>
Mark IX, 42 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν’ - ‘eis ten thalassan’ - ‘into the sea’.
</p>
<p>
Mark IX, 43, 45, 47 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν ζωὴν’ - ‘eis ten zoen’ - ‘into the life’. ‘εἰς τὴν γέενναν, εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἄσβεστον’ - ‘eis ten geennan, eis to pyr to asbeston’ - ‘into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark IX, 47 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘eis ten basileian tou theou’ - ‘into the Kingdom of God’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark IX, 50 &mdash; ‘ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε’ - ‘en tini auto artysete’ - ‘in what you season it (salt); with what you season it (food), prepare it; in what you prepare it (food)’. These are multivalent words that can refer to salt as such, but also to food if the salt were to become unsalted. In fact, according to the meaning of the passage, the option with food, not salt, is preferable - salt is auxiliary, and food is the main thing. The problem is not with the salt, but with the food, which will lose its taste. Therefore, the most accurate rendering is ‘with what you prepare it (the food)’. ‘ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα, καὶ εἰρηνεύετε ἐν ἀλλήλοις’ - ‘ekhete en heautois ala, kai eireneuete en allelois’ - ‘do have salt in yourselves, and do have peace with one another’. 
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 1 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας’ - ‘eis ta oria tes Ioudaias’ - ‘into the land of the Judaea’.
