<reading>(Romans II, 28 ‚Äî III, 18 ) </reading><br>
Romans III:5 &mdash; '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us' (our). 
</p>
<p>
Romans III:8 &mdash; '·º°Œº·æ∂œÇ' - 'emas' - 'us'.

The reading continues the following one with which the two verses are shared:<br>

</p>
<p>
Paul, in some seemingly incomprehensible reasoning, shows that people tend to misunderstand their relationship with God, the meaning and significance of the Law and circumcision. And this applies to everyone, regardless of their background or nationality.
</p>
<p>
In particular, people tend to misattribute righteousness and unrighteousness between God and themselves, attributing righteousness to themselves and unrighteousness to God. When this is expressed explicitly, it is quickly exposed and rejected, defeated, and when it is implicitly, hidden, it causes confusion.<br>

<p>
Paul emphasises God's righteousness and the sins of the people for whom the Law is given but not kept.
</p>
<p>
He rejects the schemes of reasoning that try to justify people's sins by some special relationship with God, such as receiving the Law, participating in God's work, etc. If this were to justify people, then we need to remember that all people participate in God's Providence, because God knows everything and cares about each person. And so, if this were to justify people, then everyone would be justified, regardless of what they are and what they do or have done. 
</p>
<p>
As an example, Paul addresses the misconception that those who participate in special events from God, events that clearly glorify the Lord, in which He reveals Himself more clearly, are <q>automatically</q> justified by God. In fact, participation in special events does not justify people's sins, because everyone is invited by God to participate in them &mdash; Christ suffered for everyone, so everyone is invited to participate in these events, but not everyone is justified.
</p>
<p>
If we go a little deeper into these thoughts, Paul denies a certain <q>magical thinking</q> when people see the meaning of God's Revelation, in particular the giving of the Law, and thus the meaning of faith and godliness, not in union with God, but in the execution of rituals, ceremonies, etc., in fact in external forms of godliness and faith, and evaluate events by external manifestations, for example, miracles.

<reading>(1 Corinthians XII, 27 &mdash; XIII, 8; Matthew X, 1, 5-8 ) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XIII, 2 &mdash; 'ŒµŒπŒºŒπ' - 'eimi' - (I) am. It is used for emphasis.
