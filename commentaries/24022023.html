<p>There were no New Testament readings today, but the readings were
from the Old Testament about fasting.</p>

<p><reading>(Zechariah VIII, 7-17, 19-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>Wednesday’s readings addition. If
Joel’s fasting is a time of godly sorrow for salvation, then in
Zechariah, fasting is a time of joy for salvation. But there was no
redemption in the Old Testament by the Savior, so this is not the time
of joy itself, but the time of waiting for it, but it is actually the
subject of prophecy. Zechariah prophesies of the joy that fasting should
give, or rather the Lord in connection with it, in the time of the New
Testament.</p>
<p>In New Testament times, both thoughts about fasting can be carried
out at the same time, so even the concept in the spiritual writings
exists of <q>joyful sadness</q>, which in Greek is even one word. Sounds like
an oxymoron, that is, a combination of opposing concepts in one artistic
image that helps to express something important. Fasting is not intended
to give preference (or compensate) for any individual and personal
characteristics, such as, for example, to make a lively (cheerful)
person more calm, and calm to revive (become more cheerful), but he
seeks to inflate life with feelings, sincere and deep. These feelings
should lead a person to God, to him-/herself, to other people. That is,
fasting actually changes what hurts it. Otherwise, on an emotional,
sensual level, fasting will not be experienced and will not bear fruit
in this area as it could.</p>
<p>Now for some details.</p>
<p>Through the mouth of a prophet, the Lord promises to save and <q>be God
to the people in truth and righteousness.</q> The details of the words show
that <q>truth</q> can also mean <q>firmness, faithfulness.</q> That is, to
actually be synonymous with faith. Therefore, to be God to the people
<q>in faith, truth, firmness, certainty, and righteousness.</q></p>
<p>The prophet says <q>Be courageous, be strengthened!</q> twice. Why? In
connection with God’s blessing. This is important — you need to be
strengthened in all good, because God blesses it.</p>
<p>God’s designs are spoken of regarding the permission of God
(concerning sins) and the will, the true desire of God for good. In the
Old Testament, these actually two different attitudes of God are often
depicted in the same way as <q>God’s design.</q> But God <q>did not create
evil,</q> <q>love does not think evil,</q> that is, it refers to God’s
Providence, His omniscience. God knows about everything, but he fights
evil, and gives good, encourages it and multiplies it. More on the topic
is in the essay at the link:

<p>Zechariah VIII, 19 — ‘The fast of the fourth month, The fast of the
fifth, The fast of the seventh, And the fast of the tenth, Shall be joy
and gladness and cheerful feasts For the house of Judah. Therefore love
truth and peace.’ Four references to fasting point in particular to four
multi-day fasts in traditional Christianity (although the countdown is
different).</p>
<p>Details of the words <q>for joy</q> — <q>for cheerfulness, specifically when
welcoming</q> (the word not very often used in the Old Testament), <q>for
gladness</q> — <q>for joy, gladness in a broad sense</q> (often used word for
joy), <q>for good (in a broad sense, pleasant, good) holidays</q> — <q>good
definite time, season, place, or designated meeting, can also be used as
a preliminary signal of something similar.</q> <q>truth</q> is the same word as
above, synonymous with faith and faithfullness, trust and certainty.
<q>peace</q> and <q>love</q> are words often used in Scripture.</p>

<p>
Zechariah VIII, 23 — <q>Let us go with you, for we have heard that
God is with you.</q> — related to Isaiah’s prophecy: <q>Behold, the virgin
shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel</q> (Isaiah
VII, 14), <q>which is translated, <q>God with us.</q></q> (Matthew I, 23).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
