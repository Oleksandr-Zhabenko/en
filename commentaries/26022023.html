<p><reading>(Romans XIII, 11  &ndash; XIV, 4) </reading>
</p>
<p>Today’s daily reading is a call to wake up
from spiritual sleep, to throw away evil deeds, thoughts, words and
intentions, instead to be such ones that when the Lord will come, when
the secret will be revealed, we will be in the light and not in the
darkness.</p>
<p><q>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ</q>  &ndash; perhaps a person is not ready to
completely renew his / her life, to completely change in one moment, to
fill his / her whole heart, soul and mind with light, to approach
perfection, but every person can change in Christ, to what, in fact,
Paul urges. A person can dress himself / herself  &ndash; similarly he / she
can take good thoughts, he / she can fulfill the commandment, he / she
can serve Christ and his neighbors, etc.</p>
<p><q>Do not turn care for the body into lust</q>  &ndash; literally <q>do not create
thoughts about the body in advance (as a destination) in lust</q>  &ndash; very
deep words, people can <q>create (something) in (to, into) lust</q>, that is,
they can <q>creatively form</q> their sins , and it is precisely this latter
that must be guarded against and avoided.</p>
<p><q>Accept the weak in faith not for disputes about views</q> — <q>not in (as
a destination) judging (distinguishing) thoughts, plans, movements of
the heart</q> — do not burden the unconfirmed with great vigilance, on the
contrary, you need to show mutual support, unity and solidarity in good,
in Christ.</p>
<p>The desire to <q>correct one’s neighbour</q> may come not from love for
God, for him / her, and for oneself, but from other motives, and then
such a desire can even lead to distrust in God that He cares for every
person. This is what Paul teaches to avoid.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VI, 14-21) </reading>
</p>
<p>About the importance of forgiveness  &ndash; here you
use the word <q>let go, send away from yourself</q>  &ndash; that is, <q>not hold</q>.
And even then God <q>will not hold</q>. It talks about the importance, but
does not explicitly say how it should be done (the way). But the first
thing you can do is <q>look at it with God’s eyes</q>, that is <q>accept God</q>
in this situation.</p>
<p>About fasting  &ndash; similarly to yesterday’s readings  &ndash; the same
considerations and words.

<p>But also specifically about fasting  &ndash; you don’t need to <q>change your
appearance for sadness</q>, but on the contrary  &ndash; you need to make sure
that both soul and body are renewed. In this regard, many people talk
about Lent, in particular Great Lent, as a spiritual <q>spring</q>, a time of
renewal, awakening. See also previous words at the links:

<p><q>Treasure</q> is originally <q>treasury</q>, i.e. <q>a place of storage of
treasures and valuables</q>. The key verse to understanding the Sermon on
the Mount is Matthew 6:21.</p>
