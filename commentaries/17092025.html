it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Galatians III, 15-22) </reading><br>
Galatians III, 17 — &#39;ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ&#39; - &#39;hypo tou theou&#39; - <q>by God</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; with genitive case, indicates here the passive voice of the participle <q>established</q>. &#39;εἰς τὸ καταργῆσαι&#39; - &#39;eis to katargesai&#39; - <q>unto bringing to nautght, abolishing; for bringing to naught, abolishing</q>. That is (since here is negation) does not lead to that.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 18, 21 — &#39;ἐκ νόμου&#39; - &#39;ek nomou&#39; - <q>from the Law</q>. &#39;ἐξ ἐπαγγελίας&#39; - &#39;ex epangelias&#39; - <q>from promise</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in different forms here emphasises the source, from where the inheritance, by virtue of what.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 19 — &#39;ἐν χειρὶ&#39; - &#39;en kheiri&#39; - <q>in hand; with hand</q>. Rather the second variant, since it is much more understandable. Actually a brief explanation of the meaning that the Lord gave Moses the Law. Further it is said that the mediator here is called Moses, but also not only Moses, but prophets and so on, that is in general people who received Old Testament Divine Revelations.
</p>
<p>
Galatians III, 22 — &#39;ὑπὸ ἁμαρτίαν&#39; - &#39;hypo hamartian&#39; - <q>under sin</q>. Here &#39;hypo&#39; with accusative, has the meaning of <q>closing of lock</q>, that is the Law of Moses is given to reveal sin clearly and show that people need salvation from them in God. &#39;ἡ ἐπαγγελία ἐκ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ&#39; - &#39;he epangelia ek pisteos Iesou CHristou&#39; - <q>the promise from faith of Jesus Christ; the promise from faith, Jesus Christ</q>. What has faith as source, also Christ. See by the links:<br>

Here both variants of translation are possible, and the promise, faith and Christ are in numerous significant interrelations, for example, God promised Christ, God fulfils promises in Christ, Christ is the goal and cause of faith, He also accomplishes it and in many others.

<reading>(2 Corinthians VI, 1-10; Matthew XV, 21-28) </reading><br>

Matthew XV, 21 — &#39;εἰς τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος&#39; — &#39;eis ta mere Tyrou kai Sidonos&#39; - <q>into the borders (to the territory near) Tyre and Sidon</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XV, 22 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων ἐκείνων&#39; - &#39;apo ton horion ekeinon&#39; - <q>from those borders (from those territories, lands)</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that she spiritually left the traditions of those lands, perhaps repented, or that she was from there by her mother&#39;s line.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XV, 24 — &#39;εἰς τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἀπολωλότα οἴκου Ἰσραήλ&#39; - &#39;eis ta probata ta apololota oikou Israel&#39; - <q>to the sheep those lost of the house of Israel; for the sheep those lost of the house of Israel</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, in the first case the preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates direction, the orientation of Jesus&#39;s ministry at that time, in the second — the purpose of ministry.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XV, 27 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῶν ψιχίων&#39; - &#39;apo ton psikhion&#39; - <q>from the crumbs</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here indicates that it is spoken about that those crumbs leave the food on the table, falling down. Very peculiar humility of the woman. &#39;τῶν πιπτόντων ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;ton piptonton apo tes trapezes ton kyrion auton&#39; - <q>that fall from the tables of their masters</q>. The prepositions &#39;apo&#39; indicate that crumbs fall from tables downward. Such detail indicates the meaning of Jesus&#39;s conversation with the woman — Jesus shows that when the Lord shows mercy, He can show it even there where He <q>supposedly should not have</q>.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XV, 28 — &#39;ἀπὸ τῆς ὥρας ἐκείνης&#39; - &#39;apo tes horas ekeines&#39; - <q>from that hour; (beginning the count) from that hour</q>. Here the preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates the beginning of time count, that is <q>from then</q>.
