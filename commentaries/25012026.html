it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Timothy IV, 9-15) </reading><br>
1 Timothy IV, 10 — &#39;εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ&#39; — &#39;eis touto gar&#39; - <q>because for this</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates the purpose of the action. &#39;ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ θεῷ ζῶντι, ὅς ἐστιν σωτὴρ πάντων ἀνθρώπων, μάλιστα πιστῶν&#39; - &#39;elpikamen epi theo zonti hos estin soter panton anthropon malista piston&#39; - <q>having placed hope upon the Living God, Who is Saviour for all people, especially the faithful</q> — God saves all (did, does and will do everything to save all), but not all will be saved. Nevertheless, eloquent witness about the salvation also of non-Christians.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy IV, 12 — &#39;μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω&#39; — &#39;medeis sou tes neotetos kataphroneito&#39; - <q>let no one be against your youth; let no one despise your youth</q>. This is a warning against prejudice. <q>Young, inexperienced, whom can he teach?</q> — a false reasoning (but does age itself teach people, does not the Lord?). &#39;ἐν λόγῳ, ἐν ἀναστροφῇ, ἐν ἀγάπῃ, ἐν πίστει, ἐν ἁγνείᾳ&#39; - &#39;en logo, en anastrophe, en agape, en pistei, en agneia&#39; - <q>in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity; with word, with conduct, with love, with faith, with purity</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that Timothy is called to be a concrete example of virtues and life, and the second — that each named virtue of Timothy himself and his very life in general are to be an example for others.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy IV, 14 — &#39;ἐν σοὶ&#39; — &#39;en soi&#39; - <q>in you</q>. In whom.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy IV, 15 — &#39;ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι&#39; — &#39;en toutois isthi&#39; - <q>be in these</q>. In what. <q>progress, evident to all</q> — the faithful do not need to be ashamed of successes in good.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul gives counsel to the disciple Timothy, but they are also relevant especially for all preachers. About what is important one needs to remind, to remark, to draw the attention of others and one&#39;s own. One also needs to notice God&#39;s action.
</p>

<reading>(Luke XIX, 1-10) </reading><br>
Luke XIX, 3 — &#39;ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου&#39; — &#39;apo tou okhlou&#39; - <q>from the crowd; of the crowd</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that Zacchaeus either could not rise higher than the crowd (that is, to go beyond the crowd, to become closer to Jesus at least visually, in the seeing of Him), in order to see Jesus, or that the crowd pushed him back and was an additional cause of that Zacchaeus could not see Jesus, although he already tried.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 4 — &#39;εἰς τὸ ἔμπροσθεν&#39; — &#39;eis to emprosthen&#39; - <q>ahead</q> (whither). Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 5 — &#39;ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου&#39; — &#39;eis to oiko sou&#39; - <q>in your house</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 7 — &#39;παρὰ ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ&#39; — &#39;para hamartolo andri&#39; - <q>in vicinity of a sinful man; near a sinful man</q>. The preposition &#39;para&#39; here with the dative case indicates that the crowd thought that Jesus instead of them chose a sinful man, in order to enter to him, in order to draw near with him.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 9 — &#39;σήμερον σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο&#39; - &#39;semeron soteria to oiko touto egeneto&#39; - <q>today salvation to this house came to be (occurred)</q>. The translation deepens (emphasises) the connection between the coming of Christ and salvation. Salvation here at the same time both as an event (which occurred), and as a state (whah the state is). We need salvation not only in the time of transition from fall and sin to faithfulness, but also in the state of faithfulness. Salvation happens, not only when the Lord delivers the person, but also when they are in God&#39;s safety, in God in safety. Thus, we can always strive for salvation, which leads to striving for the Saviour Himself, desire to be with Christ and in Christ.

The reading serves as an introduction to the preparation for Great Lent. From today begins the preparation for Great Lent, the time of repentance and purification, the time of preparation for the joyful meeting of the Bright Resurrection of Christ. Factually the Paschal cycle begins, which lasts somewhat more than a third of the year — up to the 1st Sunday after Pentecost (4 preparatory weeks for Great Lent, 6 weeks of Great Lent, Holy Week, 7 weeks from Pascha to Pentecost, 1 week after Pentecost, together 19 weeks, this year this is until 7 June inclusively).

</p>
<p>
A well-known story, which shows, in particular, how God interacts with people in the matter of salvation. Zacchaeus makes steps towards meeting Jesus, and He responds contrary to the expectations of all. One also needs to remember that God first calls Zacchaeus by His grace, and he responds. If people always manifested such harmony with God as Zacchaeus here, then they would not sin — through co-action with God they would do that to which God called them.
