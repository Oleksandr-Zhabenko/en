<p><reading>(Philippians I, 12-20) </reading>
</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterday’s reading, with
which it has 3 verses in common (12-14), which is referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="10102023.html">10102023.html</a></p>
<p>Philippians I, 20  &ndash; ‘παρρησια’  &ndash; ‘parresia’  &ndash; ‘boldness, courage,
confidence, freedom’ (with all boldness, freedom, courage,
confidence).</p>
<p>Philippians I, 17  &ndash; ‘θλιψιν εγειρειν τοις δεσμοις μου’  &ndash; ‘thlipsin
egeirein tois desmois mou’  &ndash; literally ‘persecution to raise my chains’.
I think that Paul is saying here that insincere preachers try to preach
out of their own ambition, without taking into account the fact that by
their insincere preaching they can increase (cause additional)
persecution and intensify Paul’s own suffering for Christ.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says that by his example he inspired others to
preach Christ boldly, and this would serve to save Paul himself through
the prayers of the faithful for him and the work of Jesus Christ and the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that if a person acts in the Holy
Spirit, rightly, then if someone else tries to use this to their
advantage for different purposes, this will not negate the rightness and
holiness of the first person’s actions, nor will it bring them to
nothing, but the rightness and holiness will be preserved by the Holy
Spirit Himself.</p>
<p>It all depends on the Holy Spirit  &ndash; whether He really leads the
person to those actions or not. If He does, then such actions are holy
and right, as described above. But if the actions look good, but it is
not the Holy Spirit Who leads to them, then such apparently good actions
are most likely not really good, and the first person needs to act with
great care and prudence, wisdom, and consideration of the possibility
that someone else may use them for another purpose  &ndash; all in order not to
become a victim of their own imprudence, shortsightedness, and naivety.
Most importantly, one must seek what is truly God’s will.</p>
<p>In the case of Paul’s preaching, he testifies that it is the Holy
Spirit working through him, and that is why he rejoices.</p>
