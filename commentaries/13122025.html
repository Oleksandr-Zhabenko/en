it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

Luke XXI, 12 — &#39;εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς καὶ φυλακάς&#39; — &#39;eis tas synagogas kai phylakas&#39; - <q>into synagogues and prisons</q>. Where to. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here that this will be undesirable for the disciples.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 13 — &#39;εἰς μαρτύριον&#39; — &#39;eis martyrion&#39; - <q>for testimony</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here the purpose.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 14 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;en tais kardiais hymon&#39; - <q>in your hearts</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 16 — &#39;ὑπὸ γονέων καὶ ἀδελφῶν καὶ συγγενῶν καὶ φίλων&#39; — &#39;hypo goneon kai adelphon kai syngenon kai philon&#39; - <q>by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case and indicates the passive state of the participle, which is translated as <q>will be betrayed</q>. See more at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/commentaries/vystup-2025-hypo-genitive-Romans-XIII_1.pdf</a><br>
It is spoken about a warning that betrayals will occur in the lives of the faithful from other people close to them. In general it is necessary to understand that if there is a situation which is a challenge, which can lead to the question: whose side to take, with whom to remain, whom not to abandon, and the faithful, being truly faithful, will not betray others, then others may fall and betray them. And such situations will happen, which the Lord warns about. Seeing certain objective preconditions, one cannot think that people will be intentionally hostile to Christians, although this is quite possible and happens, but the situations described in Christ&#39;s words will arise from time to time, in these or those places. The truthfulness of these words is confirmed by the entire history of Christianity up to now. &#39;ἐξ ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;ex hymon&#39; - <q>of you</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; in its form before the following vowel indicates choice from among a group of people. Not all will become martyrs, but some will become.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 17 — &#39;ὑπὸ πάντων&#39; — &#39;hypo panton&#39; - <q>by all</q>. The preposition &#39;hypo&#39; here with the genitive case, as above. It is meant that the very attitude to Christianity will be negative, and hence to its bearers, Christians. It is necessary to understand that to be true Christians means in all societies in all times and epochs to stand out among the surroundings.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 18 — &#39;ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;ek tes kephales hymon&#39; - <q>from your head</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates from where the hairs. An unusual combination of <q>head</q> in the singular and <q>your</q> in the plural. The singular emphasises that Christ cares for each person personally, and now addresses each confessor, martyr personally, and the plural emphasises that this is an address to all and to the Church in general.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 19 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ὑπομονῇ ὑμῶν&#39; — &#39;en te hypomone hymon&#39; - <q>in patience; with patience</q>. That is by the ability to wait, preserving faithfulness, which is steadfastness. Both variants of translation are possible, which complement one another. The combination is similar to the previous verse, but patience as an abstract noun is rarely used in the plural.

<reading>(Luke X, 19-21) </reading><br>
Luke X, 20 — &#39;ἐν τούτῳ&#39; — &#39;en touto&#39; - <q>in this; with this</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, moreover the first indicates the perception of authority over spirits as a state in which the disciples are, and the second — on what <q>moves</q>, <q>animates</q>, <q>encourages</q> joy, on what rejoices the disciples. &#39;ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς&#39; - &#39;en tois ouranois&#39; - <q>in the heavens; with the heavens</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, moreover the first indicates that the Lord granted glory to each apostle, and more generally — to disciples both male and female, in the heavens, and the second — that the apostles and faithful disciples both male and female of Christ have eternal, imperishable significance, heavenly glory which they manifest to the world. The struggle with the evil one will cease in the Kingdom of God, but this glory will continue eternally.
</p>
<p>
Luke X, 21 — &#39;Ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ&#39; — &#39;En aute te hora&#39; — <q>in that hour; then</q>. Common expression. &#39;ἐν τῷ πνεύματι&#39; - &#39;en to pneumati&#39; - <q>in the Spirit</q>. Indicates being in the Spirit. Here an indication of the personal relationship of the Son and the Spirit. &#39;ἀπὸ σοφῶν&#39; - &#39;apo sophon&#39; - <q>from the wise</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; here indicates that those wise remained aside, and therefore did not receive from God what would correspond to people&#39;s thought about them.
