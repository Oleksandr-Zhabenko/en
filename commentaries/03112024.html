it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms &mdash; or less often, denies &mdash; that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
<reading>(2 Corinthians XI, 31 — XII, 9) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians XI, 31 &mdash; ‘εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας’ - ‘eis tous aionas’ - ‘’in the ages'. A common expression.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians 11:32 &mdash; ‘ἐν Δαμασκῷ’ - ‘en Damasko’ - ‘in Damascus’. 
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XI, 33 &mdash; ‘ἐν σαργάνῃ’ - ‘en sargane’ - ‘in a basket’.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 1 &mdash; ‘εἰς ὀπτασίας’ - ‘eis optasias’ - ‘to visions’. Here the preposition ‘eis’ indicates a movement towards visions and revelations.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 2, 3 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ’ - ‘en CHristo’ - ‘in Christ’. ‘ἐν σώματι’ - ‘en somati’ - ‘in the body; by the body’. The first translation is more likely, since in the second case the soul and spirit are implicitly implied, since they were there with the body in that case.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 4 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν παράδεισον’ - ‘eis ton paradeison’ - ‘into paradise; to paradise’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates here where Paul was taken (it is logical and commonly assumed that he is writing about himself).
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 5, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις’ - ‘en tais astheneiais’ - ‘in weaknesses; by weaknesses’. Both translations are possible - the first indicates that these circumstances are like a background for the action of God's grace, which the latter is really important, and the second indicates that the very weaknesses become a cause for glory and praise, if they do not prevent or rather help a person to unite with the grace of God, with God.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 6 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἐμὲ’ - ‘eis eme’ - ‘in me’. ‘ἐξ ἐμοῦ’ - ‘ex emou’ - ‘from me’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates from where the person hears the apostle's words in his communication with them.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 8 &mdash; 'ἀπ' ἐμοῦ' - <q>ap emou</q> - <q>from me</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that the apostle asked that the angel leave him completely, entirely.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians XII, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ’ - ‘en astheneia’ - ‘in weakness; by weakness’. The first translation is more likely, since the second one contrasts God's power and human weakness, while combining them into one, which is contradictory.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke VIII, 41-56) </reading><br>
Luke VIII, 41 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τοὺς πόδας’ - ‘para tous podas’ - ‘to the proximity of the feet; closer to the feet’. Meaning: Jairus was trying to get closer to Jesus' feet so that He would definitely pay attention to his request. ‘εἰς τὸν οἶκον’ - ‘eis ton oikon’ - ‘into the house’. 
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 42 &mdash; ‘ἐν δὲ τῷ ὑπάγειν’ - ‘en de to hypagein’ - ‘when He was walking’. That is, while walking.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 43 &mdash; ‘ἐν ῥύσει αἵματος’ - ‘en rysei haimatos’ - ‘in flux of blood; by flux of blood’. In other words, her illness was the state she was in. ‘ἀπὸ ἐτῶν δώδεκα’ - ‘apo eton dodeka’ - ‘for twelve years’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates from how far back in time it was. It is a common way of using it. ‘ἀπ’ οὐδενὸς' - <q>ap oudenos</q> - <q>from no one</q>. She could not receive healing or treatment from anyone she had previously approached. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that she was interested in the healing.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 46 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ' - <q>ap emou</q> - <q>from Me; from Me</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ emphasises that the power, according to Jesus, went out of His body, apparently towards the woman for her healing.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 48 &mdash; ‘εἰς εἰρήνην’ - ‘eis eirenen’ - ‘’into peace; in peace; with peace‘’. Literally, the first translation means peace as a destination and a point of the movement.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 49 &mdash; ‘παρὰ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου’ - ‘para tou arkhisynagogou’ - ‘from beside the synagogue elder’. The preposition ‘para’ with the genitive case, a similar construction to that of the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father, indicates that the person was someone who was often with the synagogue leader, but was not the leader himself, someone close to him.
</p>
<p>
Luke VIII, 51 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν’ - ‘eis ten oikian’ - ‘into the house’.
