<p>(Hebrews X, 32-38) The apostle encourages the Jewish Christians (and
in them also all those who are like them) in respect of their patience
in the past for the sake of their faith (their own patience, or the
patience because of those whom they supported), encourages them to
continue to show boldness (courage, freedom , confidence, openness,
frankness, primarily in speaking, but in a broad sense).</p>
<p>Reading during Lent, near its middle, serves to encourage and support
those who are on the path of fasting to Christ, and also as a call to
those who are not yet.</p>
<p>The words about the short time before the Coming of Christ mean, as
in the prophets, that the time of patience is temporary, and the reward
is eternal and endless, and that the most important event  - endash the First
Coming has already happened, and now the second most important event is
ahead  - endash the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The mention of the <q>soul of God</q> (Hebrews X, 38) is interesting -
meaningful words. On the one hand, they mean the human soul of Jesus
Christ (by the way, a direct indication of both the fact that Christ had
a human soul and the fact that He is Lord and God), which knows that it
is at the same time the soul of God, because belongs to the Hypostasis
of the Son of God. On the other hand, if it is not meant to be about
Christ, then it is an allusion (parallel, reference to, mention of) to
the <q>breath of life</q>, through which a human while coming into being
became a <q>living soul</q>, as we read the other day from the book of
Genesis. And in this sense the words mean that if even a righteous
person departs from the Lord, he / she will lose the Source of life,
God. The third meaning is a parallel with the personal relationship
between a man and a woman, a boy and a girl  - endash the righteous one here is
of the masculine gender, the soul is feminine, and because a wife who is
left (abandoned or even betrayed) by a man will not have a real liking
and favour for him, nor also real pleasure and joy in him, so also the
Lord concerning those who were faithful and then fell away. In general,
the words are a quote from the book of the prophet Habbakuk II, 4.</p>

<p>(Mark II, 14-17) The vocation of the apostle and evangelist Matthew,
who also had another name  - endash Levi. He was the son of Alphaeus, and his
brother also became one of the 12 apostles  - endash James son of Alphaeus (or
the Younger).</p>
<p>Most interpreters believe that Matthew, being a publican, that is, a
tax collector for the occupation authorities of the Romans, those people
that were an example of sinners against social relations, against
society, who was not loved by his fellow citizens, longed for something
else, and therefore gladly responded to the call of Jesus.</p>
<p>Similarly, those publicans who surrounded Jesus longed for another
life, although, perhaps, they did not dare to make a radical change and
abandon their activities.</p>
<p>Jesus called Matthew the tax collector as an apostle, but He called
all tax collectors to repentance.</p>
<p>In another place, He will say to the Pharisees: <q>The publicans and
harlots precede you (go ahead) into the Kingdom of God, because they
have repented.</q> Here it can be seen that publicans are an example of
sins against society, in social life, and harlots (actually prostitutes)
are of sins against personal life  - endash and thus in the words of Jesus,
<q>sinners of various kinds</q> are called. Although they were the ones whose
example was supposed to make the Pharisees understand their arrogance,
such a context does not mean that Jesus justified their sins.</p>
<p>By the way, Matthew is one of my favorite saints, whose memory is
November 16 (29).</p>

<p>(1 Thessalonians IV, 13-17; John V, 24-30) Readings on commemoration
of the dead. There is a good write-up about them at the following links:

<p>There are good thoughts about antimony at the link:

<p>I draw attention to the fact that the text uses the word παρακαλειτε
(1 Thessalonians IV, 18, is not read, but completes the words of the
Apostle, which are read today). These are multi-meaningful words that
come from <q>to call close</q>, and here mean <q>comfort</q>, <q>encourage</q>, from
them we have the name of the Holy Spirit  - endash Comforter, <q>Paraclete</q>.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
