it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<p>
Of the Sunday before Christmas:<br>
<reading>(Hebrews XI, 9 &mdash; 10, 17 - 23, 32 - 40) </reading><br>
Hebrews XI, 9 &mdash; ‘εἰς γῆν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας’ - ‘eis gen tes epangelias’ - ‘into the Land of Promise’. Here the meaning is ‘moved as a foreigner to the Land of Promise’. ‘ἐν σκηναῖς’ - ‘en skenais’ - ‘in tents’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐν Ἰσαὰκ’ - ‘en Isaak’ - ‘in Isaac’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγείρειν’ - ‘ek nekron egeirein’ - ‘raise from the dead’. A common expression with this meaning. The preposition ‘ek’ here indicates where the transition takes place - from the dead to the living. ‘ἐν παραβολῇ’ - ‘en parabole’ - ‘in (pro)image; in prototype’. In other words, Abraham ‘received Isaac as the image of Christ, the Descendant,’ so we can say ‘prototype’ in this regard, although this word is not actually used in the text.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 23 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τῶν πατέρων’ - ‘hypo ton pateron’ - ‘under the parents; through the parents; by the parents’. The preposition ‘hypo’ here is with the genitive case, and its meaning here indicates the passive voice of the verb (the child was hidden by his parents). The order of the words is interesting: the faith was shown by the parents, but it is written as if it was the faith of Moses. It also has to do with the Baptism of infants, for whom their godparents profess faith. It is similar to what is written about Moses here: ‘With faith that person was baptised as an infant’.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 34 &mdash; ‘ἐδυναμώθησαν ἀπὸ ἀσθενείας’ - ‘edynamothesan apo astheneias’ - ‘were strengthened through weaknesses’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates complete healing, deliverance from infirmities. ‘ἰσχυροὶ ἐν πολέμῳ,’ - ‘iskhyroi en polemo’ - ‘strong in war’. 
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 35 &mdash; ‘ἐξ ἀναστάσεως’ - ‘ex anastaseos’ - ‘from the resurrection’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that the resurrection was the cause and source of life for the dead, otherwise their new life would not have taken place at all.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XI, 37 &mdash; ‘ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρης ἀπέθανον’ - ‘en phono makhaires apethanon’ - ‘were killed by the sword’. ‘ἐν μηλωταῖς, ἐν αἰγείοις δέρμασιν’ - ‘en melotais, en aigeiois dermasin’ - ‘in sheep's skins, in goat's skins’. 
</p>
