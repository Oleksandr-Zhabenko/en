<p><reading>(1 Thessalonians IV, 13-17; John V, 24-30) </reading>
</p>
<p>Readings on commemoration
of the dead. There is a good essays about them at the following links:

<p>I draw attention to the fact that the texts use the word παρακαλειτε
(1 Thessalonians IV, 18, is notread, but completes the words of the
Apostle that are read today). These are polysemous words that come from
from <q>to call close</q>, and here it means <q>comfort</q>, from which we have
the name of the Holy Spirit  &ndash; the Comforter, <q>Paraclete</q>.</p>

<p><reading>(Hebrews III, 12-16) </reading>
</p>
<p>From the ordinary Apostle of Saturday, it was
read about the need for people to have open hearts to God.</p>
<p>The passage is somewhat <q>taken out of context</q>, Paul just before this
spoke about how the Lord through Moses brought the Israelites out of
slavery in Egypt, and Christ is Higher than Moses.</p>
<p>Very deep words, in particular about the person himself and the
effect of grace on him / her, are beautifully written at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/BozhaBlahodat.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/BozhaBlahodat.html</a><br>
and other references mentioned there.</p>
<p>And again the word <q>comfort</q> is used, just like above.</p>
<p>I first wrote about worries about <q>today</q> and <q>tomorrow</q> on June 12,
2016.
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0XQrkTdGiP5VbSden6JAtESzhXGZwfi9js2TViFWK3h6v8Nzzy3MRB2yix1gWtfRYl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>Described in more detail in words about the readings on March 3 of
this year about the book of Genesis:
<br><a class="link2" href="03032023.html">03032023.html</a></p>
<p>Hebrews III, 14 — the word <q>hypostasis</q> is again used in a non-modern
theological sense. Here it means firm confidence, faith in Christ and
trust to Christ (as the basis of expectation).But the parallel with the
modern theological understanding of the word is also interesting  &ndash; one
can say <q>if we firmly preserve the hypostasis to the end</q> — that is, if
we are truly faithful to Christ as personalities.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark I, 35-44) </reading>
</p>
<p>The passage is in two parts  &ndash; Jesus’ solitary prayer
with the disciples, the need to preach, and the healing a leper.</p>
<p>An interesting detail about the first part  &ndash; <q>settlement</q>  &ndash; it refers
to cities without fences, large settlements, but without walls. In
modern English it would be roughly ‘country towns’.</p>
<p>
Here, again the word παρακαλων used and here means 'imploring'. (Added 2023-03-11 08:58 PM EET.)
</p>
<p><q>If you want, you can heal</q>  &ndash; the right words, indeed, if Christ
wants, then He as God can do all things. In general, there is such a
formula about God: <q>God can do whatever He wants, but not everything He
can, He wants.</q> Here, the divine nature of Jesus is clearly shown. But,
in addition to the miracle, there is also a distinctive feature
compassion  &ndash; He was <q>moved</q>, <q>having compassion</q>, that is, more
literally, <q>was moved by compassion</q>.</p>
<p>The prohibition of the healed to tell everyone — so as not to arouse
excessive interest in the most miraculous, and not to what Jesus does in
general (so that there is no distortion of the general
understanding).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
