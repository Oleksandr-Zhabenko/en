    it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

    <reading>(Hebrews III, 12-16) </reading><br>
    Hebrews III, 12 &mdash; ‘ἔν τινι ὑμῶν’ - ‘en tini hymon’ - ‘in any of you’. ‘ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ζῶντος’ - ‘en to apostenai apo theou zontos’ - ‘in departing from the Living God; in apostatising from the Living God’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is an attempt to completely leave, to discard the faith, at least in the heart, which will also certainly manifest itself outwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hebrews III, 13 &mdash; ‘τις ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘tis ex hymon’ - ‘which of you’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘hy’ indicates here that it is a question of choosing from a group of people, and this group is important for this situation as a sense-making group, i.e. it is essential that the addressees of the Epistle belong to the community of the faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hebrews III, 15 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι’ - ‘en to legesthai’ - ‘in the saying (of the following)’. That is, ‘when it is being said’. ‘ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ’ - ‘en to parapikrasmo’ - ‘in provoking; in irritating’. That is, when they provoked God's wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hebrews III, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐξ Αἰγύπτου’ - ‘ex Aigyptou’ - ‘out of Egypt’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘A’ indicates here where the Israelites came out from. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <reading>(Mark I, 35-44) </reading><br>
    Mark I, 35 &mdash; ‘εἰς ἔρημον τόπον’ - ‘eis eremon topon’ - ‘into a deserted (lonely; solitary) place’.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mark I, 38 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς ἐχομένας κωμοπόλεις’ - ‘eis tas ekhomenas komopoleis’ - ‘into the surrounding large settlements’. Here, the preposition ‘eis’ denotes the direction of movement. ‘εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ ἐξῆλθον’ - ‘eis touto gar exelthon’ - ‘for this is why I came out (from the Father)’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mark I, 39 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς αὐτῶν εἰς ὅλην τὴν Γαλιλαίαν’ - ‘eis tas synagogas auton eis holen ten Galilaian’ - ‘to their synagogues in all Galilee’. That is, He went around Galilee, did not stay in one place, and His preaching was spread by people among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mark I, 42 &mdash; ‘ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>apelthen ap autou</q> - <q>came down from him; went out from him</q>. <br>
    The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates here that it has come down completely, entirely; also the prefix ‘came down’ in ancient Greek is formed from the preposition ‘apo’.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mark I, 44 &mdash; ‘εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς’ - ‘eis martyrion autois’ - ‘for a testimony to them’. The preposition ‘eis’ here indicates purpose.
