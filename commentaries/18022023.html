<p>There were two readings today, one of which was dedicated to the dead and their resurrection. Regarding John V, 26 there is a good essay at the link:</p>
<br>
<a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Trinity.html</a>
<p><q>those who are in (as the location of) the graves will hear His [Son of God's] voice, and those who have done good will go forward to (as the destination of) resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to (as the destination of) resurrection of judgment</q> is a more accurate translation of the part of the Gospel reading about the dead and their resurrection. He suggests that the judgment is taking place in part already now, in this life â€” people are moving toward the resurrection of life or the resurrection of judgment â€” and in the resurrection itself this movement will be completed as the</p>
<p>attainment of the destination of the movement.</p>

<p><reading>(1 Thessalonians IV, 13-17) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the Apostle on memorial Saturday, we read about the resurrection of the dead. The main idea is that the resurrection and the change of the living will take place simultaneously, together with the transition to eternity.</p>

<p><reading>(1 Corinthians X, 23-28) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the ordinary Apostle it was read that food is not <q>pure</q> or <q>impure</q> in itself, because it is a creation of God, but it can become impure in the situation of its use together with idolatry. The generalization of the thought is also correct  &ndash; nature is not bad in itself, but there is a need not to use it in a situation where the use is associated with sin. For example, you can build a house from trees, but when cutting down trees occurs with the ecological losses, then such use of wood must be abandoned (because it would be a sin).</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XXI, 8-9, 25-27, 33-36) </reading>

<p>Short excerpts from the words of Jesus about the approach of the Second Coming. The fact that the Second Coming will be unexpected is well written at the link:</p>

<p>In general, reading is designed to <q>wake up</q> a person from a sense of self-arrogance, from a state of self-reliance, from the desire to live <q>without God</q>.</p>
<p><q>&hellip; and stand before the Son of Man</q> â€” that is, to be established, to stand firm.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
