<p>There were two readings today, one of which was dedicated to the great saints of Christ, Saints Athanasius the Great and Cyril of Alexandria.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XII, 18-27) </reading>
</p>

<p>From the daily Gospel, we read about the resurrection of the dead, about the fact that <q>with God all are alive</q>, about marriage. I wrote about it earlier, see the link:</p>
<p><a class="link2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Chb1ievMWbm/">https://www.instagram.com/p/Chb1ievMWbm/</a></p>

<p><reading>(1 Peter III, 10-22) </reading>
</p>

<p>Peter's words on various issues were read from the daily Apostle. A lot of things, a rich passage, due to lack of space I will stop only at the next one.</p>
<p>1Peter III, 17 â€” <q>After all, it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer as a doer of good things than a doer of evil</q>, literally <q>because it is better, doing good (co-creating with God), if it is God's will, to suffer than doing evil (creating evil)</q>. <q>God's will</q> â€” that is, God permits those sufferings. The apostle does not say to seek suffering, but to create (co-create with God) good. If the Lord allows suffering, then it is better for the suffering person to remain good-doer than to be evil. God's will may wish us to struggle suffering and overcome it (for example, the Lord heals and teaches us not to neglect the work of doctors and the gifts of healing), at the same time God's permission (allowance) for suffering in Scripture can also be called 'God's will', and then God's actual will, not permission, it is for us to be patient in doing good. Suffering itself is a consequence of sin, in the Kingdom of God it will not exist.</p>
<p>1 Peter III, 21  &ndash; the correct translation is <q>request, inquiry of good conscience</q>, not <q>promise (by a person) of good conscience</q>. A famous place, about which there is still disagreement.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
