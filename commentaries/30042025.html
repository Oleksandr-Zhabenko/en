<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: (John V, 17-24) 
John V, 19 — οὐ δύναται ὁ υἱὸς ποιεῖν ἀφ ἑαυτοῦ οὐδέν&amp;amp;#39; - ou dynatai ho hyios poiein aph heautou ouden - the Son cannot create (do) anything from Himself. Only creation from Himself is denied. The same idea is true of the Son&amp;amp;#39;s speaking from Himself, as I have written on John XVI, 13, and John XVIII, 34:
https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/18042025. html
The preposition &amp;amp;#39;apo&amp;amp;#39; in its form before the following &amp;amp;#39;he&amp;amp;#39; indicates here that the actions are those which can be perceived and cognised apart from the Son of God Himself, i.e. they are actions towards creation and not within the Trinity: It means that the Son in the Trinity, in the relationship within the Holy Trinity, can act, clearly and distinctly manifesting His Hypostasis, that He is the Son, not the Father or the Holy Spirit, and He Himself ‘sees’ what and how the Father creates (do), this vision is His own, ‘His own for Himself’, whereas here it refers only to actions concerning creation. In other words, only creation is referred to here — and with regard to the relationship of the Hypostases within the Trinity, one can see ‘the Son from Himself’ (but then it is better to use the ancient Greek koine ek heautou, since it is impossible then and here to somehow ‘objectivate’ the actions of the Hypostasis from the Hypostasis Himself directly, so apo is inappropriate here). Since none of the Hypostases of God does anything outside the Trinity without prior concordance within the Trinity, this is a way of seeing the richness of God&amp;amp;#39;s relationships - within the Trinity, the Hypostases both counsel and can act in broader contexts, while in creation, ‘out there,’ their actions are more closely linked to each other. Consider, for example, the creation of the human being. In the Trinity, God speaks to the other Hypostases about the creation of the human being (the Hypostasis that speaks obviously acts differently here, more ‘from Himself’, because the Others are listening), but the action of creation itself is described by a verb in the singular."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts IV, 13-22) </reading><br>
Acts IV, 17 — ‘εἰς τὸν λαόν’ - ‘eis ton laon’ - ‘into the people; in the people’. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here a spreading, a distribution in uncertain and uncontrolled limits (which the elders wanted to avoid).

John V, 24 — <q>εἰς κρίσιν</q> - <q>eis krisin</q> - <q>into judgement; for judgement</q>. Rather, the former, since the latter has the connotation that people for some reason have a certain purpose in coming to judgement. &#39;ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν&#39; - ‘ek tou thanatou eis ten zoen’ - ‘from the death to the life’. The pair of prepositions ‘ek’ - ‘eis’ emphasises the transition from the death to the life.
