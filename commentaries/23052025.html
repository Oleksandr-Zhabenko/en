(Acts XV, 5-34) 
Acts XV, 5 — ‘τινες τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς αἱρέσεως τῶν Φαρισαίων πεπιστευκότες’ — ‘tines ton apo tes aireseos ton Pharisaion pepisteukotes’ — ‘some of the party (sect) of the Pharisees who had believed’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that these Christians were not typical Pharisees who shared all the views of the Pharisees; rather, they were some with their own distinct perspective, though they had become believers. Alternatively, this same preposition can be understood to mean that they had overcome the prevailing prejudice against Christ and had come out of Pharisaism, becoming Christians — yet Pharisaic views still exerted a certain influence on them. As the text proceeds, it becomes evident (contrary to a widespread opinion which is, in fact, refuted by this and other texts) that none of the apostles demanded such requirements from the faithful.

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Acts XV, 5-34) </reading><br>
Acts XV, 5 — ‘τινες τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς αἱρέσεως τῶν Φαρισαίων πεπιστευκότες’ — ‘tines ton apo tes aireseos ton Pharisaion pepisteukotes’ — ‘some of the party (sect) of the Pharisees who had believed’.<br>
The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that these Christians were not typical Pharisees who shared all the views of the Pharisees; rather, they were <q>some</q> with their own distinct perspective, though they had become believers. Alternatively, this same preposition can be understood to mean that they had overcome the prevailing prejudice against Christ and had come out of Pharisaism, becoming Christians — yet Pharisaic views still exerted a certain influence on them. As the text proceeds, it becomes evident (contrary to a widespread opinion which is, in fact, refuted by this and other texts) that none of the apostles demanded such requirements from the faithful.<br>

</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 7 — ‘ἀφ’ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων’ — ‘aph hemeron arkhaion’ — ‘from ancient days’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following ‘he’ indicates a point of beginning of counting. ‘ἐν ὑμῖν’ — ‘en hymin’ — ‘in you’. Where, within which community.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 12 — ‘ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν’ — ‘en tois ethnesin’ — ‘in the nations; in the Gentiles’. Where, among whom. In context, the latter rendering is more appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 14 — ‘ἐπεσκέψατο λαβεῖν ἐξ ἐθνῶν λαὸν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ’ — ‘epeskepsato labein ex ethnon laon to onomati autou’ — ‘He looked upon to take from among the Gentiles a people for His Name; He visited to receive from the Gentiles a people for His Name’. Both translations are possible and complementary. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that these former Gentiles are now representatives of their nations before God and the Church.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 18 — ‘ἀπ’ αἰῶνος’ — ‘ap aionos’ — ‘from eternity’. A common expression. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates a starting point.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 19 — ‘μὴ παρενοχλεῖν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν θεόν’ — ‘me parenokhlein tois apo ton ethnon epistrephousin epi ton theon’ — ‘not to trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning (back, so as to see, to look at, to look toward; the state opposite of <q>turning away from God</q>) to God’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that these converts to God have ceased to be Gentiles — they are now fully members of God’s people, the Church, the community of the faithful.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 21 — ‘ἐκ γενεῶν ἀρχαίων’ — ‘ek geneon arkhaion’ — ‘from ancient generations; from long ago’. A common expression indicating tradition, a continuity of state passed down from generation to generation regardless of what preceded Moses. ‘ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς’ — ‘en tais synagogais’ — ‘in the synagogues’. Where.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 22, 30 — ‘ἄνδρας ἐξ αὐτῶν’ — ‘andras ex auton’ — ‘men from among them’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel here shows that these chosen men became representatives of the Council for those to whom they were sent. ‘εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν’ — ‘eis Antiokheian’ — ‘to Antioch’. Where to. ‘ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς’ — ‘en tois adelphois’ — ‘in the brethren; within the brethren; amidst the brothers’. The third rendering is grammatically and semantically most appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 23 — ‘τοῖς ἐξ ἐθνῶν’ — ‘tois ex ethnon’ — ‘those from among the Gentiles’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following vowel here refers to the origin of those Christians who were formerly Gentiles.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 24 — ‘τινὲς ἐξ ἡμῶν’ — ‘tines ex hemon’ — ‘some from among us’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘he’ shows that those people were participants in the community of believers, which the apostles here identify themselves as representing. See also the commentary above on Acts XV, 5.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 29 — ‘ἐξ ὧν’ — ‘ex hon’ — ‘from which’. The preposition ‘ek’ in its form before the following ‘ho’ here indicates that one should abstain from all such sins, including for ritual reasons — one of the main themes of the Apostolic Council in Jerusalem. A parallel is drawn between abstaining from them and the resurrection from the dead.
</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 33 — ‘ἀπελύθησαν μετ’ εἰρήνης ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν’ — ‘apelythesan met eirenes apo ton adelphon’ — ‘they were dismissed with peace from the brethren’. The preposition ‘apo’ here indicates that peace was granted and received among them. See more on peace at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Acts XV, 35 — ‘ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ’ — ‘en Antiokheia’ — ‘in Antioch’. Where.

<reading>(John X, 17-28 ) </reading><br>
John X, 18 — ‘οὐδεὶς αἴρει αὐτὴν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ, ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ τίθημι αὐτὴν ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ’ — ‘oudeis airei auten ap emou, all ego tithemi auten ap emautou’ — <q>No one lifts it up from Me, but I lay it down from Myself.</q> This speaks about the sacrifice and freedom of the Lord Jesus Christ. The meaning is built on the opposition <q>to lift up – to lay down.</q> The preposition &#39;apo&#39; in its form before the vowel indicates first that no one can take Christ’s life away, and secondly that He Himself voluntarily offers (sacrifices) and gives it.

<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19052025.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/19052025.html</a><br>

It is important that Christ, the Son of God, offers His life as a voluntary Sacrifice by Himself; no one forces Him, no one <q>sacrifices</q> the Son of God (not even the Father), but He does this Himself. This also emphasises the value of life. Also, the same preposition in the second case indicates that Christ’s Sacrifice does not disappear but is given as a gift — like the gift of grace, bestowed upon believers not as a sacrifice but as true life, resurrection.<br>
‘ταύτην τὴν ἐντολὴν ἔλαβον παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου’ — ‘tauten ten entolen elabon para tou patros mou’ — <q>This command I received from beside My Father.</q><br>
The preposition para here is with the genitive case. This construction is used concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and also regarding the human nature of Jesus Christ. See more at:<br>

This indicates the human nature of Jesus Christ, that He received this command as a human, specifically through association with the Father, the prayer. See also:<br>

The first indicates that Christ acts as the Only Begotten Son of the Father; the second — that He is the Father’s Representative, acting on behalf of the Father, from Him.
</p>
<p>
John X, 26 — ‘ὅτι οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐκ τῶν προβάτων τῶν ἐμῶν’ — ‘hoti ouk este ek ton probaton ton emon’ — <q>because you are not of My sheep.</q> The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates that those Jews were not disciples of Christ.
</p>
<p>
John X, 28 — ‘εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα’ — ‘eis ton aiona’ — <q>for ever.</q> A common expression. ‘ἐκ τῆς χειρός μου’ — ‘ek tes kheiros mou’ — <q>out of My hand.</q> From where. There is no one stronger than Christ.
