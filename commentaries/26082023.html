<p><reading>(1 Corinthians I, 26-29) </reading>
</p>
<p>Continuation of the reading referred to by
the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="20052023.html">20052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>I also wrote briefly about the main topic earlier, see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="14042023.html">14042023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Paul writes that the true reason for praise must be the Lord Himself.
For if it is not the Lord Who is the cause of praise, then it is easy
for a person to fall into various sins  &ndash; first of all, arrogance and
vanity, but also any other. But if the Lord is the cause of praise, then
such praise is both the glorification of God and leads to joy in God.
This does not mean that one can only praise God explicitly by calling on
His name, but that one can also praise God indirectly by recognising and
thanking God for what He gives, which means that one should discover,
remember, cherish, develop and increase in praise the God-givenness of
it when the cause of praise is truly from God. A believer may be praised
by unbelievers, for example, for their virtues, achievements, work,
etc., but the believer should not lose touch with God, develop and
multiply the God-givenness, and then such praise with this attitude
should bring the person closer to God.</p>
<p>The opposite of this is the state when a person does not appreciate
God-givenness of what they have, and then, even if they have praise from
people, they will not receive praise from God.</p>
<p>And another thought is that it is good (maybe even better) to praise
God directly, and sometimes it is just necessary.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XX, 29-34) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew XX, 30, 31  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>Matthew XX, 32  &ndash; â€˜Î·Î¼Ï‰Î½â€™  &ndash; â€˜emonâ€™  &ndash; (to) â€˜usâ€™.</p>
<p>The continuation of the reading that was referred to by the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="03082023.html">03082023.html</a><br></p>
<p>A similar story to the one considered here:
<br><a class="link2" href="23072023.html">23072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Mark also has a similar story, but there is only one blind man, and
he is even named Bartimaeus (son of Timaeus). It could probably be the
same event, but Mark mentions only one of the two blind men. It is also
possible that these are different events, but then Christ healed three
blind men in the neighbourhood of Jericho in a similar way.</p>
<p>A lesson in prayer and faith, also a testimony to the so-called
Lordâ€™s Prayer (see the second link above for more details).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
