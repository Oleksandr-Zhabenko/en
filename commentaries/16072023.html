<p><reading>(Romans XII, 6-14) </reading>
</p>
<p>I wrote a little earlier, and I quote: <q>The
apostle teaches how to interact with Godâ€™s gifts.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll focus on one phrase from the first one  &ndash; <q>whoever gives, in
sincerity (sincerely, with one heart, without two minds)</q> (Romans XII,
8).</p>
<p>It is important to remember that sin often does not want to give up,
and even good deeds, thoughts, and feelings are often used for its own
benefit. That is why it is good to give, as the Lord testifies through
Paul, but the extraordinary need for Christian giving is to give with
the whole heart, wholeheartedly, sincerely. Just as Christian
stewardship should be true leadership that inspires and empowers (see
ibid.).</q></p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IX, 1-8 ) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew IX, 1  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î²Î±Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜embasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜enteringâ€™
(into) (a boat).</p>
<p>The healing of the paralysed man through the faith of his companions,
and the forgiveness of sins. Here the Lord forgives sins  &ndash; by the faith
of his companions (neighbours) for the glory of God and as a testimony
to Himself and to God. That is, the apparent purpose of this is also
Godâ€™s glory.</p>
<p>We are often accustomed to seeing forgiveness of sins as primarily
Godâ€™s mercy and love, but in Scripture we can find forgiveness of sins
as a manifestation of Godâ€™s righteousness (justice) (cf:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0BJ8SEbWQtcz6YspNHAcG4GUyArottEzDUcgbqT5dqCjuW9Us1p3kLubjxBkz7uFXl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a><br>
), and here  &ndash; Godâ€™s glory. But these reasons do not deny Godâ€™s love and
mercy, they presuppose them.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the forgiveness of sins was through
the faith of others.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
