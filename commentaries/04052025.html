it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Matins:<br>
<reading>(Mark XVI, 9-20) </reading><br>
Mark XVI, 9 — <q>ἐφάνη πρῶτον Μαρίᾳ τῇ Μαγδαληνῇ, ἀφ</q> ἧς ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτὰ δαιμόνια' - 'ephane proton Maria te Magdalene, aph hes ekbeblekei hepta daimonia' - <q>first of all, He appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons</q>. Mary Magdalene, my beloved Saint, was no longer demon-possessed when she became a disciple of Christ, because Christ first cast out demons from her. The preposition <q>apo</q> in its form before the following <q>he</q> indicates here that He cast out completely, totally, utterly.
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 11 — <q>ἐθεάθη ὑπ</q> αὐτῆς' - <q>etheathe hyp autes</q> - <q>was seen by her</q>. The preposition <q>hypo</q> in its form before the following vowel is here with the genitive case and indicates that it is the passive voice of the participle <q>was seen</q> (by whom).
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 12 — <q>δυσὶν ἐξ αὐτῶν</q> - <q>dysin ex auton</q> - <q>to two of them</q>. The preposition <q>ek</q> in its form before the following vowel indicates that the disciples are being referred to as representatives of the disciples, i.e. those two disciples (Cleopas and, as is believed, Luke, my beloved Saint) had the same thoughts and position as the rest of them. 'ἐφανερώθη ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ, πορευομένοις εἰς ἀγρόν' - ‘ephanerothe en hetera morphe, poreuomenois eis agron’ - ‘appeared in another appearance to travellers into the countryside (to the countryside, in fact, it is Emmaus)’. The words about the appearance are used because the disciples did not recognise Jesus for a long time, He wore different clothes and their eyes were ‘reserved’. They must have been so engrossed in conversation and thoughts that they did not pay proper attention to their interlocutor and fellow traveller, Jesus. It happens to people whose attention is habitual (secondary automatic attention, sustained attention following voluntary control), tied to something even without their direct efforts, which indicates how important everything was to them in their lives. It also suggests that, unlike Thomas, who wanted to check with his senses, these two disciples believed with their hearts and minds, obeyed Jesus because of His teaching, precepts, commandments, and example, etc. The order of Jesus' appearances to them, and only later to Thomas, indicates that people often first accept the truth in their hearts, minds, and faith, and then verify it bodily by seeing it fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 15 — ‘πορευθέντες εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἅπαντα’ - ‘poreuthentes eis ton kosmon apanta’ - ‘go into the world whole’. Where. That is, there are actually two commandments here - to go into the world, and not to divide the world into parts, but to preach to the whole world, to everyone. That is, it is not enough just to preach all over the world, but it is important to bring the Gospel of Christ to everyone, without dividing people.
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 17 — <q>ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου</q> - <q>en to onomati mou</q> - <q>in My name; with My name</q>. Both translations are possible: the first indicates that the disciples must be truly Christ's, His representatives, and the second that the power itself is given to people by Christ, He is the Lord, and therefore the Authority, the Lord of all.
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 19 — ‘ἀνελήμφθη εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν’ - ‘enelemphthe eis ton ouranon’ - ‘ascended into the heaven’. Where to. 'καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ θεοῦ' - <q>kai ekathisen ek dexion tou theou</q> - <q>and sat down from the right hand of God (the Father)</q>. That is, in the highest glory, which belongs only to God. These words are included in the Creed. The preposition 'ek' is part of a common expression here.
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Acts VI, 1-7) </reading><br>
Acts VI, 1 — ‘Ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις’ - ‘En de tais hemerais tautais’ - ‘in those days’. 'ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ τῇ καθημερινῇ' - ‘en te diakonia te kathemerine’ - ‘in the daily ministry’. In other words, there was more care on the days of worship, and less on other days.
</p>
<p>
Acts VI, 3 — ‘ἄνδρας ἐξ ὑμῶν’ - ‘andras ex hymon’ - ‘men from among you’. The preposition <q>ek</q> in its form before the following <q>hy</q> indicates that the disciples, the community of believers, are being referred to.
</p>
<p>
Acts VI, 7 — <q>ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ</q> - <q>en Hierousalem</q> - <q>in Jerusalem</q>. Where.

<p>
Mark XVI, 3 — ‘τὸν λίθον ἐκ τῆς θύρας τοῦ μνημείου’ - ‘ton lithon ek tes thyras tou mnemeiou’ - ‘the stone from the door of the tomb’. The preposition <q>ek</q> indicates where the stone was to be rolled away from.
</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 5 — <q>εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον</q> - <q>eis to mnemeion</q> - <q>into the tomb; to the grave</q>. Where to. 'εἶδον νεανίσκον καθήμενον ἐν τοῖς δεξιοῖς περιβεβλημένον στολὴν λευκήν' - <q>eidon neaniskon kathemenon en tois dexiois peribeblemenon stolen leuken</q> - 'they saw an (adult) young man sitting on the right, dressed in a long white garment<q>. It was the angel of God in the form of a young man.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Mark XVI, 8 — <q>ἔφυγον ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου</q> - <q>ephygon apo tou mnemeiou</q> - <q>fled from the tomb</q>. That is, they ran away so that they were completely distanced from there, far away.
