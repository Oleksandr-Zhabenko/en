it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(1 John IV, 20 — V, 21) </reading><br>
1 John IV, 21 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>ap autou</q> - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates that it is a gift.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 1, 4, 18 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. The preposition ‘ek’ indicates that such a person is a child of God, comes from God as a creation and a personality who is likened to the Son of God via the gift of grace. ‘ἐξ αὐτοῦ’ - ‘ex autou’ - ‘from Him’. It refers here to the eternal birth of the Son of God from the Father. See also the reference and others cited there:  <br>

</p>
<p>
1 John V, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν τούτῳ’ - ‘en touto’ - ‘in that; by that’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 6 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ὕδατι’ - ‘en to hydati’ - ‘in the water; with the water’. The latter is logical, since it is not clear what the former would mean in relation to Christ. ‘ἐν τῷ αἵματι’ - ‘en to haimati’ - ‘in the blood; with the blood’. Similar to the previous one, the second option is logically preferable.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 8 &mdash; ‘οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσιν’ - ‘hoi treis eis to hen eisin’ - ‘these three are into one’. That is, their testimony is not only in agreement, but is the one testimony.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 10 &mdash; ‘πιστεύων εἰς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘pisteuon eis ton hyion tou theou’ - ‘believes in the Son of God’. ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ - ‘en auto’ - ‘in himself; in Him’. Both translations are possible, although the first one is traditionally used. ‘εἰς τὴν μαρτυρίαν’ - ‘eis ten martyrian’ - ‘in the testimony’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 11 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ υἱῷ’ - ‘en to hyio’ - ‘in the Son; by the Son’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating Who is the Source and the Top of that life, and the second emphasising that Christ grants and impels that life.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 13 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘eis to onoma tou hyiou tou theou’ - ‘in the name of the Son of God’. 
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 15 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ' - <q>ap autou</q> - <q>from Him</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that it is a gift.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ’ - ‘ek tou theou’ - ‘from God’. See above, it also says that God is the Source of the life of the faithful in many senses. ‘ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ’ - ‘ek to ponero’ - ‘in the evil (in the end, as a result, in general); in the wickedness’. Both translations are possible, with the first referring to sins and the second to a state of self-deception, when the world deceives itself and tries to deceive the faithful.
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 20 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ ἀληθινῷ, ἐν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ’ - ‘en to alethino, en to hyio autou Iesou CHristo’ - ‘in the true one, in His Son Jesus Christ; in the True One, in His Son Jesus Christ’. Different translations are possible; in the first one, the ‘true’ refers to the truth revealed by God, to the Revelation of God, and in the second one, to the Father (the Son and the Spirit are also True).
</p>
<p>
1 John V, 21 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων’ - ‘apo ton eidolon’ - ‘from idols’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that one is to be completely, totally, utterly beware.

<p>
<reading>(Mark XV, 1-15) </reading><br>
Mark XV, 7 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ στάσει’ - ‘en te stasei’ - ‘in the revolt’. The word is polysemous, and this is the translation that is appropriate here.
