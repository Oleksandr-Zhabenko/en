<p>There were two readings today, one of which was dedicated to the actual event of Peter's imprisonment and miraculous release.</p>

<p><reading>(1 Timothy IV, 9-15) </reading>
</p>

<p>Paul's teachings to his disciple and friend Timothy were read from the daily Apostle.</p>
<p><q>putting hope in the Living God, Who is the Savior of all people, especially the faithful</q> â€” God saves everyone (has done, is doing and will do everything to save everyone), but not everyone will be saved. Nevertheless, eloquent testimony about the salvation of non-Christians.</p>
<p><q>Let no one despise your youth</q> is a warning against prejudice. <q>Young, inexperienced, whom can he / she teach?</q> â€” false reasoning (God teaches people or the age?).</p>
<p><q>reading</q> â€” the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p><q>prophecy</q>  &ndash; Timothy's success in preaching was revealed to the prophets.</p>
<p><q>success, obvious to all</q> â€” the faithful should not be ashamed of or be somewhat confused by the success in good deeds.</p>

<p><reading>(Luke XIX, 1-10) </reading>
</p>

<p>The story of the conversion and repentance of Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector, was read from the daily Gospel.</p>
<p><q>Now salvation has come</q>  &ndash; in the original <q>happened</q>, <q>come into being</q>  &ndash; the translation deepens (underlines) the connection between the coming of Christ and salvation.</p>
<p>Reading serves as an introduction to preparation for Lent. Preparation for Great Lent begins tomorrow, a time of repentance and purification, a time of preparation for the joyous meeting of the Bright Resurrection of Christ. In fact, the Easter cycle begins, which lasts a third of the year  &ndash; up to the 1st Sunday after Pentecost (4 preparatory weeks for Great Lent, 6 weeks of Great Lent, Holy Week, 7 weeks from Easter to Pentecost, 1 week after Fri. Pentecost, 20 weeks in total, this year it is up to and including June 11).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
