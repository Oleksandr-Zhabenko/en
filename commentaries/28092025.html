it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<p>
I prepared an improved version of my research, which is currently being prepared for publication. For now, I will leave its results undisclosed so as not to create an announcement of the publication. I hope, God willing, to present the results later after the publication comes out.
</p>
<p>
I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

To the Venerable Fathers of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, who rest in the Near (Anthony's) Caves:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians IV, 6-15) </reading><br>
2 Corinthians IV, 6 — 'ἐκ σκότους' - 'ek skotous' - <q>from darkness</q>. Here the preposition 'ek' indicates where light is to shine from, but does not indicate origin. 'ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν' - 'en tais kardiais hemon' - <q>in our hearts</q>. Where. 'ἐν προσώπῳ' - 'en prosopo' - <q>in the Person; in the face</q>. Here both translation variants are possible, with the first indicating Christ Himself as Person, and the second — His presence through His face.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 7 — 'ἐν ὀστρακίνοις σκεύεσιν' - 'en ostrakinois skeuesin' - <q>in vessels made from earth; in earthen vessels</q>. A parallel to the creation of the first man Adam from the dust of the earth. 'ἐξ ἡμῶν' - 'ex hemon' - <q>from us</q>. Here the preposition 'ek' in its form before the following 'he' indicates origin.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 8 — 'ἐν παντὶ' - 'en panti' - <q>in everything; with everything</q>. Both translation variants are possible, but rather the first variant.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 10 — 'ἐν τῷ σώματι' - 'en to somati' - <q>in the body; with the body</q>. It is meant that Christ's deadness is directly connected with the body — it is spoken of bodily afflictions — they do not harm souls, souls are alive, and bodies suffer (like Christ's body), even to the degree when old tissues of the organism die (it is spoken particularly of wounds). 'ἐν τοῖς σώμασιν' - 'en tois somasin' - <q>in bodies</q> (other ancient manuscripts give the singular here — <q>in the body</q>). Where. The apostle speaks both of eternal life in the renewed incorruptible body in the Kingdom of God, and of the action of grace now. A relevant passage particularly also in connection with the incorruption of many bodies of venerable saints.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 11 — 'εἰς θάνατον' - 'eis thanaton' - <q>into death; unto death</q>. That is, where they want to direct. 'ἐν τῇ θνητῇ σαρκὶ' - 'en te thnete sarki' - <q>in mortal flesh</q>. Here <q>flesh</q> is said instead of <q>body</q> to emphasise the humility of the faithful.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 12 — 'ἐν ἡμῖν' - 'en hemin' - <q>in us</q>. 'ἐν ὑμῖν' - 'en hymin' - <q>in you</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Corinthians IV, 15 — 'εἰς τὴν δόξαν τοῦ θεοῦ' - 'eis ten doxan tou theou' - <q>unto the glory of God; for the glory of God</q>. Here the preposition 'eis' indicates the purpose of action.
