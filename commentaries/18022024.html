<p>
The apostle Paul gives advice to his disciple Timothy, but it is also especially relevant for all preachers. We need to remind ourselves of the important things, to point them out, to draw the attention of others and our own. We also need to notice God's action.

<reading>(Luke XIX, 1-10) </reading><br>
Luke XIX, 4 &mdash; 'ἔμπροσθεν' - 'emprosthen' - 'before; in front of; in the face of'. 'ἤμελλεν' - 'emellen' - 'was about to' - from 'μέλλω'.
</p>
<p>
Luke XIX, 8 &mdash; 'ἡμίσειά' - 'emiseia' - 'halves' (plural in the ancient Greek).
</p>
<p>
The story of Zacchaeus' repentance, the beginning of the preparatory readings for Lent.
</p>
<p>
For a brief summary, please refer to the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/29012023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/29012023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
A well-known story that shows, in particular, how God interacts with people in the work of salvation. Zacchaeus takes steps towards Jesus, and He responds contrary to everyone's expectations. We also need to remember that implicitly, but in reality, God is the first to call a person with His grace, and Zacchaeus responds. If people always showed such alignment with God as Zacchaeus did here, they would not sin &mdash; all that because of their cooperation with God.

Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
