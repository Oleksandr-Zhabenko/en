<p>(1 Corinthians III, 9-17) Continuation of the readings described in
the links:

<p>In turn, the continuation of this reading is the one referred to
here:
<br><a class="link2" href="13072023.html">13072023.html</a><br></p>
<p>1 Corinthians III, 10, 11, 12 - ‘θεμελιον’ - ‘themelion’ - <q>that
belongs to the foundations, the basis</q>.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians III, 13 - ‘ημερα’ - ‘emera’ - ‘day’.</p>
<p>The image of a building and architecture is an interesting one - in
relation to the works of every person, and especially Christians.
Different materials show the different values that people put into their
spiritual work. What does not burn, but is purified and renewed in the
fire, represents God’s true values, that is, what is worthy of praise in
God’s eyes. What burns and sometimes flares up represents that which
only has the appearance of value, which looks valuable to people, but
has no real value.</p>
<p>A person will be saved <q>as if through fire</q> - words that give many
people hope. God’s Judgement is called here the fire, and it will be
very difficult for such a person to answer. And why, then, will the
person named here be saved? Because they are God’s temple, created in
God’s image, and God will save them out of inexpressible mercy. Someone
might think that everyone will be saved. But no, not everyone. Here we
see that in order to be saved, we need to <q>build</q> God’s house, that is,
cooperate with God’s grace in the work of salvation. The quality of this
cooperation may vary, but it is necessary for salvation.</p>
<p>If a person does not really care about it, he or she is not
cooperating.</p>
<p>In terms of the value of materials, we can also say that those who
built with valuable materials that do not burn are those who can be set
as examples for everyone, and those who built with less valuable
materials are those who cannot be set as examples, but upon whom God
will have mercy in the most clear sense of the words.</p>
<p>Paul also emphasises the value of the human person and of human life,
both physical and spiritual.</p>
<p>(Matthew XIV, 22-34) Matthew XIV, 22 - ‘εμβαναι’ - ‘embanai’ - ‘get
into the boat’.</p>
<p>Matthew XIV, 26 - ‘φαντασμα’ - ‘phantasma’ - ‘vision, mirage,
fantasy, dream’. That is, the disciples thought it was an illusion or a
mirage.</p>
<p>Matthew XIV, 27 - ‘ειμι’ - ‘eimi’ - (I) ‘am’. It is used for
emphasis.</p>
<p>The miracle of Jesus and Peter walking on the water is a lesson in
faith, courage, prayer and God’s strength.</p>
<p>Peter interacts with God’s grace and goes to meet Christ by His will.
This is exactly what Christ calls everyone to do, but in a certain
<q>excess</q>. It shows that among the faithful there will be those who want
to <q>do more than the Lord directly commands</q>. But such an impulse, as in
the case of Peter, can face many challenges (here the storm symbolises
these challenges, although all these events were not allegories but
real).</p>
<p>The story of Peter’s faith as he walked and his unbelief when he
doubted is described in detail here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html</a><br></p>
<p>I also note that the Lord here says to Peter very directly and
confidently - <q>Go!</q>, not <q>Try!</q> (as He is going, but as God is
controlling the situation with the storm and waters).</p>
<p>All of this shows, among other things, that Christ as a human being
(by human nature) did not lack courage and determination when even the
most determined Peter caved in to the situation.</p>
<p>This is a story that teaches courage and faith.</p>

John XV, 17 - XVI, 2) See the links:
