<p>To the Apostles Peter and Paul:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians XI, 21  &ndash; XII, 9) </reading><br>
 About
the work of the Apostle Paul from his mouth. He boasts because it is
necessary for the salvation of his brothers and sisters, not for his
glory or honour from people. Some people recognize only experience, so
for such Paul speaks of his experience in the Holy Spirit. From the XI
chapter  &ndash; about patience and difficulties, suffering and more physical
work, in the XII chapter  &ndash; about the spiritual and the revelation of
God.</p>
<p>It can also be noticed that Paul does not encourage anyone to boast
in such a way, but speaks about himself <q>from the third person, from the
side</q>, also it was not possible to convey the word of God to those
people in any other way.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XII, 5  &ndash; ‘εμαυτου’  &ndash; ‘emautou’  &ndash; <q>myself</q>.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XII, 6  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; (about) <q>me</q>. ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’
- (about) <q>me</q> (in Greek, these are two different expressions
grammatically, therefore different forms).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XII, 8  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’  &ndash; (depart from, left)
<q>me</q>.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians XII, 9  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; (in) <q>me</q>.</p>
<p>Paul says that <q>the power of God in weakness reaches completion (a
word that comes from</q>end, goal”)<q>. That is, human weakness can serve as
a means of overcoming all temptations through the action of God’s power
at the same time. We can say that on the example of Paul in this
situation, we see that for a person whom God strengthens and empowers,
to whom He gives strength, his or her own human weaknesses can then
serve as a means of victory over temptations (and therefore sins). It
can be said in another way: if God strengthens a person, then either a
strong person or a weak person both can overcome temptations and sins
because of this God’s power. it is worth mentioning that there is a
similar example in the Old Testament  &ndash; the Lord saved Israel from the
Midianites through Gideon and 300 men, a small number, so that later the
Israelites would not boast that they had won by themselves, and not God
had won for them.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XVI, 13-19) </reading>
</p>
<p>About Simon Peter.</p>
<p>Matthew XVI, 14  &ndash; according to tradition and prophecies, it was
Elijah and Jeremiah who were to come before the Coming of the
Messiah-Christ. John the Baptist was just before the First Coming in the
spirit and power of Elijah, and it is widely believed that Elijah
himself, who is still alive in heaven, will return before the Second
Coming.</p>
<p>Matthew XVI, 17  &ndash; <q>son of Jonah</q>  &ndash; in other ancient manuscripts -
<q>son of John</q>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all the promises of Jesus to Peter refer to
the fact that Peter will act in Jesus Christ, in the Holy Spirit. This
is also evident from the fact that soon Peter received a rebuke from
Jesus, when he began to think with his purely human ideas and reasoning,
and not God’s.</p>
<p>Other apostles received similar authority, with the same
specification. Tomorrow (that is, today local time) the Council of the
12 Apostles.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
