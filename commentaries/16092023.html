<p>To the Saturday after the Exaltation:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians I, 26-29; John
VIII, 21-30) </reading><br>
 For the readings from the Apostle, see the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="26082023.html">26082023.html</a></p>
<p>For the readings from the Gospel, see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="12052023.html">12052023.html</a></p>

<p><reading>(1 Corinthians IV, 17  &ndash; V, 5) </reading>
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians V, 4  &ndash; ‘εμου’  &ndash; ‘emou’ -
‘my’. ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 5:5  &ndash; ‘ημερα’  &ndash; ‘emera’  &ndash; (on the) ‘day’.</p>
<p>Direct continuation of the reading mentioned at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="13082023.html">13082023.html</a></p>
<p>And the continuation of today’s reading is the one referred to at the
following link:
<br><a class="link2" href="27032023.html">27032023.html</a></p>
<p>Paul speaks of the need to recall the truths of the faith and to
follow good examples, particularly those of the apostles.</p>
<p>He also goes on to speak of his intention to come, and also passes
judgement on an unrepentant Christian sinner who had committed the sin
of fornication, and was not ashamed of it, but the other Corinthians
were not in agreement about how to treat this.</p>
<p>Paul judges <q>in absentia</q> (just as one can judge the rightness or
wrongness of something without being a direct witness to it, but on the
basis of truthful testimony and proof, justification), but the decision
is often misunderstood as a curse on the guilty.</p>
<p>No, Paul does not curse anyone, does not wish the sinner to perish,
but wishes to testify that the latter’s work is of the devil, devilish,
and also tempts other Christians. To <q>deliver</q> here means to testify
that the person has fallen into the net of the evil one, and also -
because of his unrepentance  &ndash; to dissolve Christian unity with him (to
excommunicate him from the community of believers, from the common
Communion).</p>
<p>It must also be said that in the time of the Apostle Paul, when
Christians were in a small minority among the Gentiles, this meant a
testimony to the conscience of a person, a call to sober up and
repentance.</p>
<p>It must be said that the sinner sincerely repented afterwards, and
Paul again asked the believers to receive him.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXIV, 1-13) </reading>

<p>I wrote earlier, see the link (here I quote the
relevant part of the text):

<p>The words about the destruction of the temple are described here, as
well as the fact that the coming of Christ will be manifest to all
(about the lightning):

<p>Matthew XXIV, 12 is well written about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Matthew24-12.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/Matthew24-12.html</a><br>
”</p>
<p>To the Great Martyr Euphemia the All-praised:<br>
<reading>(2 Corinthians VI,
1-10; Luke VII, 36-50) </reading><br>
 For the Gospel reading, see (Saint Euphemia as an
example of love in suffering):
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid02psdV3fTUXzk4k2Hopd9TnQxT3ryr8iGpLNqXsJ1N9eViXy4JBA3W9SBmU7NqQ4btl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p>As for the readings from the Apostle, Paul writes about the apostolic
work, with many challenges but with many fruits, and the Saint Martyr in
her virtuous life and suffering for Christ was likened to that work.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
