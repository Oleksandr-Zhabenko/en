<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: Of the Apostle from the Seventy Timothy:
(2 Timothy I, 3-9; Luke X, 1-15) 
2 Timothy I, 3 — &amp;#39;ἀπὸ προγόνων&amp;#39; — &amp;#39;apo progonon&amp;#39; - from forefathers. The preposition &amp;#39;apo&amp;#39; indicates the beginning of the reckoning of time from that. ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει&amp;#39; - &amp;#39;en kathara syneidesei&amp;#39; - in a pure conscience; with a pure conscience. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that a pure conscience is constant for Paul, and the second — that the very ministry requires a pure conscience. It is meant not that Paul had no reproaches of conscience or penitent moods, but that he consciously and thoughtfully, consistently dedicated his life from childhood to the service of God, chose the path to Him as the main path of his life. This consciousness could be combined in Saul with persecutions of Christians in ignorance, but could not leave him such after conversion to Christ. ἐν ταῖς δεήσεσίν&amp;#39; - &amp;#39;en tais deesesin&amp;#39; - in prayers; in supplications. More precise is the second variant, that is, it is spoken about persistent and diligent prayer with faith."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<reading>(Mark XI, 27-33) </reading><br>
This morning I found an interesting post by sister in Christ Vassa Larin:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.facebook.com/SisterVassa/posts/pfbid0JC2bNsRGBTfzsxqHV2h8A2xxDT53RtSVWNcGo6tYYC6fRA2ZPJGcsuz2KrzRj2b5l">https://www.facebook.com/SisterVassa/posts/</a><br>
Sister Vassa writes that the chief priests and those who were with them, in the answer that they do not know (feigned ignorance), were dishonest, and therefore Christ left them without an answer as to by what authority He does this. These reflections prompted me to a thought which sister Vassa herself, and also some other people, supported.
</p>
<p>
Here is this thought. The essence lay in persuasion. The chief priests demanded from Christ proofs why they ought to believe. But since the question of Christ led them not to persuasion and faith, but to hypocrisy and demonstration of even greater uncertainty, then it is entirely logical that Christ did not continue the conversation. One of the reasons is also that He did not wish to push the opponents to even greater biases.

Of the Apostle from the Seventy Timothy:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy I, 3-9; Luke X, 1-15) </reading><br>
2 Timothy I, 3 — &#39;ἀπὸ προγόνων&#39; — &#39;apo progonon&#39; - <q>from forefathers</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates the beginning of the reckoning of time from that. &#39;ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει&#39; - &#39;en kathara syneidesei&#39; - <q>in a pure conscience; with a pure conscience</q>. Both variants of translation are possible, the first indicates that a pure conscience is constant for Paul, and the second — that the very ministry requires a pure conscience. It is meant not that Paul had no reproaches of conscience or penitent moods, but that he consciously and thoughtfully, consistently dedicated his life from childhood to the service of God, chose the path to Him as the main path of his life. This consciousness could be combined in Saul with persecutions of Christians in ignorance, but could not leave him such after conversion to Christ. &#39;ἐν ταῖς δεήσεσίν&#39; - &#39;en tais deesesin&#39; - <q>in prayers; in supplications</q>. More precise is the second variant, that is, it is spoken about persistent and diligent prayer with faith.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 5, 6 — &#39;ἐν σοὶ&#39; — &#39;en soi&#39; - <q>in you</q>. &#39;ἐν τῇ μάμμῃ σου Λωΐδι καὶ τῇ μητρί σου Εὐνίκῃ&#39; - &#39;en te mamme sou Loidi kai te metri sou Eunike&#39; - <q>in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice</q>.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy I, 9 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ&#39; — &#39;en CHristo Iesou&#39; — <q>in Christ Jesus</q>. In Whom.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul as the elder and teacher of Timothy reminds Timothy of the history of his acceptance of Christ, his pious family and encourages by this to grow in faith. He expresses his faith in Timothy, in his powers and faithfulness to Christ.
</p>
<p>
The 7th verse needs to be understood as a contrast — that human, not divine fear diminishes, with which is not well combined, that Paul also calls here — power, love and wisdom give people powers to overcome and to be rid of human fears.
</p>
<p>
Concerning the fear of God — it is not spoken here, but it is spoken about human, ordinary fear. This latter is not from God, but can even lead the person to perdition if he completely yields to it. The Apostle Paul as also in some other places, following the Old Testament people, does not distinguish God&#39;s permission and God&#39;s will, about which I wrote more in other places, see in particular by the links:<br>
