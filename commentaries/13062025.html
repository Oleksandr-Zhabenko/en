it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Romans II, 14-29) </reading><br>
Romans II, 15 — &#39;τὸ ἔργον τοῦ νόμου γραπτὸν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν&#39; - &#39;to ergon tou nomou grapton en tais kardiais auton&#39; - <q>the work of the Law written in their hearts</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 16 — &#39;ἐν ἡμέρᾳ&#39; - &#39;en hemera&#39; - <q>in the day; at the day</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 17 — &#39;καυχᾶσαι ἐν θεῷ&#39; - &#39;kaukhasai en theo&#39; - <q>boastest in God; boastest with God</q>. Both translation variants are possible, but the first has advantage in meaning. The first indicates that boasting has foundation and basis in God, He is its cause, and the second — that to human desire to boast God <q>as if a means is subordinated</q>, which is sin before God.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 18 — &#39;ἐκ τοῦ νόμου&#39; - &#39;ek tou nomou&#39; - <q>from the Law</q>. From what, whence. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; indicates here the origin of what a person learns, the source.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 19 — &#39;φῶς τῶν ἐν σκότει&#39; - &#39;phos ton en skotei&#39; - <q>light of those who are in darkness</q>. Where. Light of whom, whose, and not for whom. The genitive case indicates that a person thus thinks that they serve others in this way.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 20 — &#39;ἐν τῷ νόμῳ&#39; - &#39;en to nomo&#39; - <q>in the Law</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 23 — &#39;ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι&#39; - &#39;hos en nomo kaukhasai&#39; - <q>thou who boastest with the Law</q>. Here only such translation variant is appropriate — to boast with something. Comparison with verse 17 indicates that the Law is used by such a person only as an instrument of their own boasting, as a value which they <q>as if possess</q>, but do not share.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 24 — &#39;ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν&#39; - &#39;en tois ethnesin&#39; - <q>among the nations; in the nations; by the nations; among the Gentiles; by the Gentiles</q>. Various translation options are possible, which mutually complement each other.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 26 — &#39;εἰς περιτομὴν&#39; - &#39;eis peritomen&#39; - <q>into circumcision; as circumcision</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; indicates here what the uncircumcision of such pious Gentiles shall be counted for.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 27 — &#39;ἐκ φύσεως ἀκροβυστία&#39; - &#39;ek physeos akrobystia&#39; - <q>uncircumcised from nature</q>. That is, a person who was not a Jew by faith and not an Israelite by origin. Paul here addresses as if to Jews, but generally and more precisely — to Christians who accepted Jewish rites. <q>From nature</q> here in the sense of a person who did not make a conscious choice regarding their faith or unbelief.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 28 — &#39;οὐ γὰρ ὁ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ Ἰουδαῖός ἐστιν, οὐδὲ ἡ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ ἐν σαρκὶ περιτομή&#39; - &#39;ou gar ho en to phanero Ioudaios estin, oude he en to phanero en sarki peritome&#39; - <q>for he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh</q>. Here <q>Judaism</q> (here synonym of true faith and godliness, children of faithful Abraham, of the fathers etc.) and <q>circumcision</q> — signs and symbols of true faithfulness to God, true children of God, like seals of belonging to God. Paul says that true seals of belonging to God are not external manifestations, but an entirely faithful person — in body, soul and spirit.
</p>
<p>
Romans II, 29 — &#39;ἀλλ&#39; ὁ ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ Ἰουδαῖος, καὶ περιτομὴ καρδίας ἐν πνεύματι οὐ γράμματι&#39; - &#39;all ho en to krypto Ioudaios, kai peritome kardias en pneumati ou grammati&#39; - <q>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter (with the spirit, not with the letter)</q>. Continuation of the thought of verse 28 — the presence of the Holy Spirit, grace, and not symbols and external form are the true seals.

<reading>(Matthew V, 33-41) </reading><br>
Matthew V, 34 — &#39;μήτε ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ&#39; - &#39;mete en to ourano&#39; - <q>neither by heaven</q>. That is, swear not also by heaven. By what. Detailed explanation further, after comments on verses.
</p>
<p>
Matthew V, 35 — &#39;μήτε ἐν τῇ γῇ&#39; - &#39;mete en te ge&#39; - <q>neither by the earth</q>. Similarly to verse 34 — by what, that is, swear not by the earth. &#39;μήτε εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα&#39; - &#39;mete eis Hierosolyma&#39; - <q>neither by Jerusalem</q>. That is, swear not so, <q>that in Jerusalem they may know, hear, confirm</q>. That is, do not try to artificially add weight and significance to your words.
</p>
<p>
Matthew V, 36 — &#39;μήτε ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ σου&#39; - &#39;mete en te kephale sou&#39; - <q>neither by thy head</q>. Similarly to verses 34-35 — be aware of your real strength and possibilities. See more at the link:<br>

</p>
<p>
Matthew V, 37 — &#39;τὸ δὲ περισσὸν τούτων ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ ἐστιν&#39; - &#39;to de perisson touton ek tou ponerou estin&#39; - <q>but whatsoever is more than these is of evil (evil generally, in results, in summary, in broad sense)</q>. Similarly — see the just cited link, where the question is examined in detail and many other important things.
</p>
<p>
Matthew V, 39 — &#39;εἰς τὴν δεξιὰν σιαγόνα&#39; - &#39;eis ten dexian siagona&#39; - <q>unto the right cheek</q>. Where to.
