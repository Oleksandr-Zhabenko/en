it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
As Lent has begun, the readings from the New Testament are replaced by readings from the Old Testament to encourage people to repentance.
</p>
<p>
Since I am commenting on several Ancient Greek (koine) prepositions, I will continue to comment on the Old Testament readings by looking at the first complete translation into Ancient Greek, the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
In the 6th hour:<br>
<reading>(Isaiah V, 7-16) </reading><br>
Isaiah V, 9 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὰ ὦτα’ - ‘eis ta ota’ - ‘into the ears’. That is, ‘where to’. ‘εἰς ἔρημον ἔσονται’ - ‘eis eremon esontai’ - ‘will become a desert’. That is, they will turn into what. ‘ἐν αὐταῖς’ - ‘en autais’ - ‘in them’. 
</p>
<p>
Isaiah V, 16 &mdash; ‘ἐν κρίματι’ - ‘en krimati’ - ‘in the court; with the court’. Both translations are possible, with the second indicating that the Judgement of God itself will be a manifestation of God's majesty. ‘ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ’ - ‘en diaiosyne’ - ‘in justice; with justice’. Similar to the previous one.

</p>
<p>
At vespers:<br>
<reading>(Genesis IV, 8-15) </reading><br>
Genesis IV, 8 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸ πεδίον’ - ‘eis to pedion’ - ‘into the plain; into the field on the plain’. ‘ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ’ - ‘en to einai autous en to pedio’ - ‘as they were in the plain (in the field)’.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IV, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τῆς γῆς’ - ‘ek tes ges’ - ‘from the ground; from the earth’. That is, ‘whence’.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IV, 11 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς’ - ‘apo tes ges’ - ‘from the earth’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Cain had sinned against nature, not only against God, so nature would cause him additional suffering. ‘ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου’ - ‘ek tes kheiros sou’ - ‘out of your hand’. That is, ‘whence’.
</p>
<p>
Genesis IV, 14 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου σου’ - ‘apo prosopou tes ges kai apo tou prosopou sou’ - ‘from the face of the earth and from your face’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that Cain will try his best to avoid both God and nature (‘the way to nowhere’).

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Proverbs V, 1-15) </reading><br>
Proverbs V, 3 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ χειλέων’ - ‘apo kheileon’ - ‘out of the mouth’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that the honey leaves her mouth, which adds to the meaning of wasting.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs V, 5 &mdash; ‘εἰς τὸν ᾅδην’ - ‘eis ton haden’ - ‘to hell’. That is, where they lead.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs V, 8 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ αὐτῆς' - <q>ap autes</q> - <q>from her</q>. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the following vowel indicates that one must move away completely, totally, completely.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs V, 10 &mdash; ‘εἰς οἴκους ἀλλοτρίων’ - ‘eis oikous allotrion’ - ‘into strange houses’. That is, so that strangers and foreigners do not disassemble them.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs V, 14 &mdash; ‘παρ’ ὀλίγον' - <q>par oligon</q> - <q>almost; almost</q>. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the accusative case and indicates that only a little the following did not happen. ‘ἐν παντὶ κακῷ ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας καὶ συναγωγῆς’ - ‘en panti kako en meso ekklesias kai synagoges’ - ‘in all the evil among the chosen and the assembly; in all the evil among the Church and the assembly; in all the evil among the Church and the synagogue’. Although the latter options appear to be timeless, they may be prophetically present.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs V, 15 &mdash; ‘ἀπὸ σῶν ἀγγείων καὶ ἀπὸ σῶν φρεάτων’ - ‘apo son angeion kai apo son phreaton’ - ‘from your vessel and from your well’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that these are gifts.
