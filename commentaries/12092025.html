it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(Galatians II, 6-10) </reading><br>
Galatians II, 6 — 'ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν δοκούντων' - 'apo de ton dokounton' - <q>and regarding those who consider</q>. The preposition 'apo' here emphasises that <q>besides that, beyond that</q>, that is, a transition to a new topic of conversation.
</p>
<p>
Galatians II, 8, 9 — 'εἰς ἀποστολὴν' - 'eis apostolen' - <q>into apostleship; for apostleship</q>. That is, where God's help led — into the establishment of service as an apostle. 'εἰς τὰ ἔθνη' - 'eis ta ethne' - <q>to the nations; to the Gentiles; for the nations; for the Gentiles</q>. Here the preposition 'eis' indicates the spread of preaching not as something that Peter or Paul themselves do, but as something that spreads by God's power and therefore is not under human control (similarly used regarding the spread of rumours, for example, because they cannot be clearly controlled). Here Paul implicitly calls <q>apostleship</q> the preaching among the Jews. Although here he also shows that God helps no less in preaching among the Gentiles, whom He also cares for and wants to save. That is, these are diplomatic words of the Apostle Paul with simultaneously deep meaning.
</p>
<p>
Galatians II, 9 — 'εἰς τὴν περιτομήν' - 'eis ten peritomen' - <q>to the circumcised; for the circumcised</q>. Both variants are possible, although they are different. See the explanation above.
</p>
<p>
Paul characterises those who caused the disputes (precisely so, initially the Galatians did not have such, but they listened to Paul's teaching), that those people did not help him in any way in preaching. And also here he continues the story of his service and the question about which the letter was written.
</p>
<p>
Cephas — this is Peter (the Aramaic form of this Greek name of the Apostle Peter).
</p>
<p>
James — the Lord's brother, the first bishop of the Jerusalem Church, the head at the Apostolic Council in 51, also called the Righteous, one of the 70 apostles, author of the Catholic Epistle and the first order of the Liturgy (not to be confused here with James the son of Zebedee, the brother of John the Theologian, who at that time was already the first martyr among the 12 apostles).
</p>
<p>
John — the Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian, the beloved disciple of Jesus Christ.

<reading>(Mark V, 22-24, 35-VI, 1) </reading><br>
Mark V, 35 — 'ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώ' - 'apo tou arkhisynago' - <q>from the ruler of the synagogue</q>. The preposition 'apo' indicates here disappointment, that they did not preserve the faith which Jairus himself had shown them. That is, when he went to Jesus, he informed others, closer to the synagogue, and they thought that indeed Jesus could help, because the girl was still alive, and the rumour about Jesus's miracles was spreading. And having seen that the girl had died, and then also Jairus, who had managed to lead Jesus to himself for help, they decided that the faith was vain, they were disappointed. Jairus, having trusted Jesus, now may lose not only his daughter, but also the respect of his surroundings. A double blow for a man, therefore Jesus's encouragement later is understandable.
</p>
<p>
Mark V, 36 — 'παρακουσας' - 'parakousas' - <q>having overheard the conversation (it is meant that those people were not speaking to Jesus, but He heard their words among themselves)</q>.
</p>
<p>
Mark V, 38 — 'εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἀρχισυναγ' - 'eis ton oikon tou arkhisynag' - <q>into the house of the ruler of the synagogue</q>. That is, into the house of Jairus, where his daughter was dead and people were.
</p>
<p>
Mark VI, 1 — 'εἰς τὴν πατρίδα αὐτοῦ' - 'eis ten patrida autou' - <q>to His fatherland</q>. Where to.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<q>The girl is sleeping</q>, — said so as not to attract great attention, a miracle should bring joy, but preserve reason, and also not cause a desire for miracles. <q>Talitha, kum!</q> — these words of Jesus in Aramaic even became the name of a Ukrainian musical group. Twelve years — a peculiar peak of childhood, when a girl combines both childish, adolescent and youthful traits, through which parental love for her is especially tender (in this case of Jairus and the family).
</p>
<p>
In Mark there are more details compared to Matthew and Luke (particularly the direct quotation of Christ's words in Aramaic). Mark, according to many testimonies, wrote the Gospel from the words of the Apostle Peter, and in this case — from the words of a direct witness to these events. Therefore, his account here can be considered the most complete of all the evangelists.
