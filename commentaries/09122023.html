<meta name="description" content="The Lord, in response to the question of how many people will be saved, gives an answer... not statistical or mathematical. And we need to explain why. The question of whether many people will be saved replaces the question of the salvation of each individual, each person, with the question of comparing people with each other and assessing their compliance with an 'average standard' of what constitutes a good life. It is impossible for a person to make a correct judgement about their own salvation from the fact that many or few people are saved. Instead, the Lord says that we need to look at our capabilities and at God's commandments, God's will. As for the possibility, everyone can be saved, and therefore is called to it. If someone is not saved, it will be solely because of their failure to fulfil God's will, which 'desires all to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth'.

</p>
<p>
In response to the question of how many people will be saved, the Lord gives an answer&hellip; neither statistical nor mathematical. And we need to explain why.
</p>
<p>
The question of how many people will be saved actually replaces the question of the salvation of each individual, each person, with the question of comparing people with each other and assessing their compliance with an <q>average standard</q> of what constitutes a good life. But such an average comparison with an imaginary <q>average</q> person (wherever this imaginary <q>average</q> may lie, the achievement of which is <q>sufficient for salvation</q>), the idea of which will be formed mainly on the basis of partial observations of the lives of some people from each person's environment, does not in fact provide a satisfactory answer to the question of the salvation of each or everyone, and in particular of the person themselves.
</p>
<p>
It is impossible for a person to make a correct judgement about their own salvation from the fact that many or few people are saved.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Lord says that we need to look at our capabilities and at God's commandments, God's will.
</p>
<p>
As for the capability, everyone can be saved, and therefore is called to it. If someone does not get saved, it is solely because of their failure to fulfil God's will, which <q>desires everyone to be saved and come to the cognition of the truth.</q>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Christ speaks of living according to God's will, according to grace. And as a striking example, He gives the fact that unexpectedly for everyone, many people will be saved, and many people will not be saved (which only confirms the fallacy of comparing oneself with others to determine one's salvation).

Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
