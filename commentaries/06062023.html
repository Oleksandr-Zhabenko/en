<p><reading>(Romans I, 1-7, 13-17) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading of the Epistles of the Holy
Apostles begins and will continue until the next Great Lent (unless the
Second Coming of Jesus Christ occurs before then). The beginning of the
Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans.</p>
<p>Romans I, 14  &ndash; ‘ειμι’  &ndash; ‘eimi’  &ndash; <q>(I) am</q>. It is used with emphasis.
A <q>debtor</q> in the sense of an unfulfilled intention to come with the
preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Romans I, 15  &ndash; ‘εμε’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘me’.</p>
<p>Romans I, 17  &ndash; literally: <q>from faith into faith</q> (as in moving from
point A to point B). That is, the revelation of the promised faith (the
<q>point of departure</q>) is called the <q>destination</q> of faith. A comparison
with a journey.</p>
<p>After the solemn greeting and confession of faith in Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, Paul speaks of his intention to write a letter that
would partially <q>compensate</q> for the fact that he had not yet arrived in
the city of Rome.</p>
<p>The epistle is to some extent <q>like Paul himself</q>, although, of
course, a text cannot replace a person.</p>
<p>Paul also speaks of the importance of the Christ’s Gospel.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew IV, 25  &ndash; V, 13) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading from the Gospel of Matthew
begins. The events related to the Nativity and Baptism are omitted, as
they will be read during the Christmas season.</p>
<p>See the explanation here:

<p>To the Venerable Simeon the Columnist, on the Strange Mountain:
(Colossians III, 12-16; Matthew XI, 27-30) There is much consonance with
yesterday’s reading from Colossians:

<q>Love is the union (bond, literally</q>that which binds”, <q>link</q>) of
perfection”  &ndash; life in virtue can be likened to a tree, where virtues are
the branches, and the branches and trunk are love. You can (and should)
manifest different ones, but love should be manifested in
everything.”</p>
<p>I would also like to note that Paul mentions <q>pity</q> (‘οικτιρμος’)
among the virtues we need, which can also be translated as <q>mercy,
compassion, sympathy</q>. It should be emphasised here that in the
Christian understanding, this virtue implies active help, i.e. it is not
just a state, experience, feeling, or sensation, but it is a <q>movement
of help</q>, which can be said to be close in meaning to <q>moving with
compassion</q>. That is, it is an active state of manifestation of
practical love where there is such an opportunity. At the same time,
where it is not possible to show practical love, the same word does NOT
mean compassion. It is impossible to have compassion for people in their
suffering from the sins of hardness of heart and cruelty, because it is
impossible for a loving heart to <q>experience together</q> anger and
cruelty, which are the antonyms of mercy. For the same reason, God does
not have compassion for hardened and cruel sinners, also blasphemers of
the Holy Spirit, because their state is the very opposite of mercy, and
this also shows why human forgiveness is important for God’s mercy.</p>
