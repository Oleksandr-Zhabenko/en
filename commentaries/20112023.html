Since tomorrow is the great feast of the Entering of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple, today we read two daily readings: for today and for tomorrow. I give them in brackets separated by semicolons.<br>
<reading>(2 Thessalonians I, 1-10; I, 10 - II, 2, read together in a row) </reading><br>
2 Thessalonians I, 1, 2, 7, 8, 10-12, II, 1, 2 - '·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emon' - 'us' (ours, we).<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 4 - '·º°Œº·æ∂œÇ' - 'emas' - 'us'.<br>
</p>
<p>
2 Thessalonians I, 10 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥' - 'emera' - (to) 'day'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul, after greeting and thanking God, comforts and encourages the Thessalonians in anticipation of the Second Coming of Christ and says that it has not yet come (contrary to the opinion of some who thought otherwise at the time, but also to those who have thought so since then, including now). <br>
</p>
<p>
Paul writes from the <q>point of view</q> of the Thessalonians themselves, i.e. he simply expresses his moral and emotional support for them in their suffering for Christ, without delving into theological and ethical issues. The Thessalonians wanted justice, so Paul writes about God as a Righteous Judge. He is indeed so, but we should not forget God's mercy and love, which are above judgement.<br>
</p>
<p>
In view of the expectation of the glorious Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the apostle encourages the faithful to do good and grow in faith and godliness.<br>
</p>
<p>
<reading>(Luke XVII, 20-25; 26-37, read together in a row) </reading><br>
Luke XVII, 22 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±Œπ' - 'emerai' - 'days'. '·º°ŒºŒµœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ' - 'emeron' - 'days'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 24, 29-31 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥' - 'emera' - '(of) 'day'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 26, 28 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±ŒπœÇ' - 'emerais' - (to) 'days' ((in the) days).<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke XVII, 27 - '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ' - 'emeras' - (to) 'day'.<br>
</p>
<p>
In fact, it is a continuation of the topic of the end of the world and the events before it, which is also raised in the Apostle's readings.<br>
</p>
<p>
Luke gives a brief account, unlike other synoptics (it is believed that he was less interested in this issue, that he sees time mainly as the time of the Church, that is, the ministry in this age, including social ministry).<br>
</p>
<p>
First, in this reading, Christ speaks about the inner state of people in the Holy Spirit: <q>righteousness, joy and peace</q> - which may well be implicit in the minds of others, or may be doubted and objected to. Instead, He goes on to speak of the general coming of the Kingdom of God after His Second Coming, similar to what is written in other synoptics.<br>
