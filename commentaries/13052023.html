<p><reading>(Acts XII, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>The daily reading of the Apostle coincides today
with the reading in honour of the Saint Apostle James of Zebedee,
brother of Saint John the Theologian, one of the closest disciples of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Recently, this passage was also read in memory of the Saint Great
Martyr George, see the link:

<p>I would like to add that the Lord permitted that James suffered
martyrdom, and saved Peter from execution in a miraculous way.</p>

<p><reading>(John VIII, 31-42) </reading>
</p>
<p>John VIII, 31  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜emoâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Mineâ€™.</p>
<p>John VIII, 37  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï‚â€™  &ndash; â€˜emosâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Mineâ€™.</p>
<p>John VIII, 42  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™  &ndash; â€˜emeâ€™  &ndash; â€˜Meâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emautouâ€™ -
â€˜Myselfâ€™.</p>
<p>Interesting reflections on freedom and sin are available here:

<p>In general, in this conversation, Jesus refutes the various excuses
of the Jews who were inclined to sin, but justified themselves by their
descent from Abraham, to whom God made promises (which we have examined
in more detail during Lent), and Christ does not speak here about His
direct descent.</p>
<p>Why does He avoid this? Because if a person tries to justify himself
or herself through ancestry, lineage, or nation, he or she will lose
much of the motivation to do good, and no blood ties alone can save a
person from sins.</p>
<p>Moreover, such a desire often prevents a person from seeing the truth
about him/herself. The Lord goes on to speak about this as well.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Himself speaks of the Father with whom He is One.</p>

<p><reading>(To the Apostle James Zebedee: Luke V, 1-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke V, 3  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î²Î±Ï‚â€™ -
â€˜embasâ€™  &ndash; â€˜having enteredâ€™.</p>
<p>Luke V, 8  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; â€˜meâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î½Î¹â€™  &ndash; â€˜eimiâ€™  &ndash; (I) â€˜amâ€™. It is
used only with emphasis.</p>
<p>The story of Jesusâ€™ second calling of His closest disciples. The
first one is described in the Gospel of John I. The apostles continued
to be fishermen, but they were also disciples of Jesus.</p>
<p>Here, after the miraculous fishing, after the miracle performed by
Christ, they changed their attitude to all that and began to consider
discipleship of Jesus as the main occupation in their lives
(nevertheless, they continued to be fishermen until Pentecost after the
Ascension of Jesus).</p>
<p>The miracle has many meanings, in particular, it teaches humility,
obedience to God, trust in Him and shows the disciples what the Lord
calls them to do (to apostolic work).</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
