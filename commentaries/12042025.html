<meta name="description" content="Several quotes from the text: John XI, 25 — 'ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ' - 'ho pisteuon eis eme' - whoever believes in(to) Me. The preposition 'eis' indicates here that faith is a movement towards a goal, here towards Christ. Believing in Him is a movement towards Him, a movement of faith, the goal and final point of which is Christ. An indication of deification. (John XI, 1-45) 
John XI, 1 — 'Λάζαρος ἀπὸ Βηθανίας, ἐκ τῆς κώμης τῆς Μαρίας καὶ Μάρθας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτῆς' - 'Lazaros apo Bethanias, ek tes komes tes Marias kai Marthas tes adelphes autes' - Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and Martha, her sister. The preposition 'apo' indicates here that Lazarus did not meet Jesus in Bethany, but traveled to Him; the preposition 'ek' indicates that he came originally from the village of Mary and Martha. It is believed that this village was Bethany."><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(Hebrews XII, 28-XIII, 8 ) </reading><br>
Hebrews XIII, 3 — ‘αὐτοὶ ὄντες ἐν σώματι’ - ‘autoi ontes en somati’ - ‘yourselves are in the body’. This means that evil can be done directly to a person in this life, before the Second Coming of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XIII, 4 — ‘τίμιος ὁ γάμος ἐν πᾶσιν’ - ‘timios ho gamos en pasin’ - ‘honourable marriage in all; precious marriage in all'. It is about values.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews XIII, 8 — ‘εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας’ - ‘eis tous aionas’ - ‘into the ages; forever and ever’. This means that it will continue to spread endlessly, forever.

<reading>(John XI, 1-45) </reading><br>
John XI, 1 — 'Λάζαρος ἀπὸ Βηθανίας, ἐκ τῆς κώμης τῆς Μαρίας καὶ Μάρθας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτῆς' - 'Lazaros apo Bethanias, ek tes komes tes Marias kai Marthas tes adelphes autes' - <q>Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and Martha, her sister.</q> The preposition 'apo' indicates here that Lazarus did not meet Jesus in Bethany, but traveled to Him; the preposition 'ek' indicates that he came originally from the village of Mary and Martha. It is believed that this village was Bethany.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 6 — 'ἐν ᾧ' - 'en ho' - <q>in which; where</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 7 — 'εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν' - 'eis ten Ioudaian' - <q>in Judea</q>. That is, to where.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 9 — 'ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ' - 'en te hemera' - <q>during the day</q>. That is, when. A fixed expression.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 10 — 'ἐν τῇ νυκτί' - 'en te nykti' - <q>at night</q>. That is, when. A fixed expression. 'ἐν αὐτῷ' - 'en auto' - <q>in him</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 17 — 'ἐν τῷ μνημείῳ' - 'en te mnemeio' - <q>in the tomb</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 18 — 'ὡς ἀπὸ σταδίων δεκαπέντε' - 'hos apo stadion dekapente' - <q>approximately distanced for fifteen stadia</q>. The preposition 'apo' here indicates an approximate distance.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 19 — 'πολλοὶ δὲ ἐκ τῶν Ἰουδαίων' - 'polloi de ek ton Ioudaion' - <q>many of the Jews</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here that these people from Judea were Jews, and that they represented to some extent the general attitude of the Judean people to Lazarus and his sisters - the latter ones were loved.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 20 — 'ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ' - 'en to oiko' - <q>in the house; at home</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 24 — 'ἀναστήσεται ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ' - 'anastesetai en te anastasei en te eskhate hemera' - <q>will rise in the resurrection of the last day</q>. That is, during the general resurrection of the dead. ChatGPT explains that the future medio-passive state of the verb <q>will rise</q> indicates that he will become a participant in the act of resurrection that God will perform. That is, he will rise not by himself, but as a participant in God's action regarding the resurrection of the dead.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 25 — 'ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ' - 'ho pisteuon eis eme' - <q>whoever believes in(to) Me</q>. The preposition 'eis' indicates here that faith is a movement towards a goal, here towards Christ. Believing in Him is a movement towards Him, a movement of faith, the goal and final point of which is Christ. An indication of deification.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 26 — 'πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ' - 'pisteuon eis eme' - <q>believes in(to) Me</q>. See verse 25. 'εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα' - 'eis ton aiona' - <q>for ever; forever</q>. A fixed expression.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 27 — 'σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἐρχόμενος' - 'sy ei ho CHristos ho hyios tou theou ho eis ton kosmon erkhomenos' - <q>You are the Christ, the Son of God, Who is coming into the world</q>. That is, He comes where to. The use of the present tense indicates that Martha did not fully realize that Christ had already come and was talking to her. That is, it is an expression of the Jews' expectation of the coming of the Messiah, the Christ, but at the same time an expression of the fact that Jesus Christ is fulfilling His ministry gradually.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 30 — 'εἰς τὴν κώμην' - 'eis ten komen' - <q>into a settlement; into a village</q>. 'ἐν τῷ τόπῳ' - 'en to topo' - <q>in a place</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 31, 38 — 'ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ' - 'en te oikia' - <q>in the house</q>. 'εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον' - 'eis to mnemeion' - <q>to the tomb</q>. That is, where to.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 37 — 'τινὲς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν' - 'tines de ex auton' - <q>some of them</q>. The preposition 'ek' in its form before the next vowel indicates here that this was a common opinion among the Jews who had come, but not all of them dared to express it.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 38 — 'ἐν ἑαυτῷ' - 'en heauto' - <q>in Himself</q>.
</p>
<p>
John XI, 45 — 'Πολλοὶ οὖν ἐκ τῶν Ἰουδαίων' - 'Polloi oun ek ton Ioudaion' - <q>Then (as a result) many of the Jews</q>. The preposition 'ek' indicates here that these Jews expressed by this the general attitude of the participants and witnesses of the events. 'ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτόν' - 'episteusan eis auton' - <q>believed in Him</q>. See the commentary on verse 25 above.
