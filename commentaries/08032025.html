it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
To the Great Martyr Theodore Tyrone:<br>
<reading>(2 Timothy II, 1 &mdash; 10; John XV, 17 - XVI, 2) </reading><br>
2 Timothy II, 1 &mdash; ‘ἐνδυναμοῦ ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘endynamou en te khariti te en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘be strengthened in the grace that is in Jesus Christ; be strengthened with the grace that is in Christ Jesus’. It is more likely the first option, since the second implies more that grace is only a means, which diminishes its real significance.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy II, 2 &mdash; ‘παρ’ ἐμοῦ' - <q>par emou</q> - <q>from near me</q>. The preposition ‘para’ in its form before the following vowel is here with the genitive case. This construction is also used in reference to the Holy Spirit's proceeding from the Father and in reference to the human nature of Jesus Christ. This indicates that the words of the apostle Paul were from the Holy Spirit, and that a good understanding of them also comes from being close to Paul.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy II, 7 &mdash; ‘σύνεσιν ἐν πᾶσιν’ - ‘synesin en pasin’ - ‘understanding in everything; mind in all things’. 
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy II, 8 &mdash; ‘Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν, ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ’ - ‘Iesoun CHriston egegermenon ek nekron, ek spermatos Daueid' - <q>Jesus Christ, Who was raised from the dead, from the seed of David</q>. The preposition ‘ek’ in the first case indicates where the transition took place - from death to life, and in the second case it indicates the descent by human nature from the lineage of King David, which was promised by the Lord.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy II, 9 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en ho’ - ‘in which; with which’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that Paul does not renounce the Gospel in persecution, and the second that it is the Gospel of Christ that gives strength and unbreakability.
</p>
<p>
2 Timothy II, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ’ - ‘en CHristo Iesou’ - ‘in Jesus Christ’. 
</p>
<p>
For more information about the reading from the Apostle, please refer to the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/21062023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/21062023.html</a>
</p>
<p>
John XV, 19 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου’ - ‘ek tou kosmou’ - ‘from the world; (out) of the world’. It is used several times with slightly different meanings. In some places it indicates (non) origin and that deeds are (not, as here it is denied) based on the laws of this world, in others it indicates choice among other people.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 21 &mdash; ‘εἰς ὑμᾶς’ - ‘eis hymas’ - ‘to you; concerning you; in the direction of you; in relation to you’. The preposition ‘eis’ indicates the direction of action.
</p>
<p>
John XV, 24 &mdash; ‘ἐν αὐτοῖς’ - ‘en autois’ - ‘’in them‘’. That is, literally ‘in their midst,’ that is, among them. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 25 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῷ νόμῳ’ - ‘en to nomo’ - ‘in the Law’. 
</p>
<p>
John XV, 26 &mdash; ‘ὁ παράκλητος ὃν ἐγὼ πέμψω ὑμῖν παρὰ τοῦ πατρός, τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας ὃ παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐκπορεύεται’ - ‘ho Parakletos hon Ego pempso hymin para tou Patros, to Pneuma tes aletheias ho para tou Patros ekporeuetai' - <q>the Comforter Whom I will send you from beside the Father, the Spirit of truth Who proceeds from beside the Father</q>. A key place in the Scriptures concerning the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Holy Trinity. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the genitive case and means roughly ‘from beside’, and the word ‘proceeds’, which is translated in this form, contains the prefix ‘ek’, formed from the preposition. This preposition is used when referring to the birth of the Son of God from the Father. See the links:<br>

and at many others, there is a detailed explanation of how these and two other prepositions are used in the question of authority, as well as in many other cases. They are among the most frequently used words in Scripture. See, for example, references to ‘para’ with the genitive case, as here:<br>

</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the preposition ‘para’ with the genitive case here implies that the Holy Spirit has the Father as its Source, as does the Son, beside the Son. In other words, the Son promises to send the Spirit, Who is with Him and the Father, from the Father. Words that profoundly point to the indivisible and inseparable Holy Trinity.

<p>
John XV, 27 &mdash; ‘ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς - ‘ap arkhes’ - ‘from the beginning’. The preposition ‘apo’ in its form before the next vowel indicates the beginning of the count.
