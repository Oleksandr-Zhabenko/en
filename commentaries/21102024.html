<reading>(Ephesians IV, 25-32) </reading><br>
Ephesians IV, 29 &mdash; ‘ἐκ τοῦ στόματος’ - ‘ek tou stomatos’ - ‘out of the mouth’. 
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 30 &mdash; ‘ἐν ᾧ’ - ‘en o’ - ‘in Whom; by Whom’. Both translations are possible. ‘εἰς ἡμέραν’ - ‘eis emeran’ - ‘on the day; for the day’. The second option is preferable in terms of meaning, since it refers to the future day of redemption, the eternal day that is to come in the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 31 &mdash; ‘ἀφ’ ὑμῶν' - <q>aph ymon</q> - <q>from you</q>. That is, let it be taken away entirely, completely.
</p>
<p>
Ephesians IV, 32 &mdash; ‘ἐν Χριστῷ’ - ‘en CHristo’ - ‘in Christ; by Christ’. Both translations are possible, although the second one is difficult to understand and imperfectly conveys the idea that the Father sent the Son to save the world by Him, and thus to forgive people's sins as part of salvation.

<reading>(Luke X, 22-24) </reading><br>
Luke X, 22 &mdash; ‘ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός’ - ‘hypo tou patros’ - ‘under the Father; through the Father’. Here the preposition ‘hypo’ is with the genitive case. Similar to Romans XIII, 1. But this is referring to the Incarnate Son of God, Jesus Christ. Based on what is written here:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17082024.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/17082024.html</a><br>
as well as the references there, it is the Incarnate Son of God who is referred to here, or rather His human nature. As a human being, He has all the gifts of God that God intended for humans &mdash; in particular, He is King, Prophet, High Priest, Christ, Saviour, Redeemer, Winner, and so on. That is, all this was ‘handed over’ to the Son as a human being according to the Father's special order, according to it. It should also be understood that some of these gifts of God are not actually those that God would have wanted the Son of God to have when He created the world and people, for example, God did not want people to sin when He created them, but He knew that they would sin as the Omniscient One. Then He sent His Son to save them, and thus, the Son of God became a human being, the Saviour, the Redeemer, the One who suffered for us and so on, and received these gifts also because of what happened to the creation and what God did not want for the creation. As I wrote at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15072023.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/15072023.html</a><br>
In Christ, God's will and God's permission coincided in a single and unique way, and He is Peculiar in this. And since suffering is not inherent in God's nature, it cannot be said that everything given to the Son in the human nature is ‘ek’ the Father or ‘para’ the Father, nor can it be ‘apo’ the Father. Therefore ‘hypo tou patros’ is used.
