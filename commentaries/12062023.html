<p><reading>(Romans II:28  &ndash; III:18) </reading>
</p>
<p>Romans III:7  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Ï‰â€™  &ndash; â€˜emoâ€™  &ndash; â€˜myâ€™
(deception) (neuter in koine).</p>
<p>Continuation of the reading:
<br><a class="link2" href="09062023.html">09062023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Paul speaks of Israel being entrusted with Godâ€™s words in the Old
Testament, but then goes on to say that all are sinners, both Israelites
and Hellenists (and in general all people except Jesus; the Mother of
God is Pure, but not sinless).</p>
<p>Paul also quotes several psalms in both places, including the
well-known psalm of repentance.</p>
<p>The point is that for a righteous person it is a great asset to have
Godâ€™s words, but for a sinful person the situation differs  &ndash; he or she
does not use this gift properly and therefore becomes subject to Godâ€™s
judgement.</p>
<p>The quotations are taken in the absolute sense, not in the partial
sense, which means that if a person turns away from the fullness of
Godâ€™s will even a little, he or she violates it; if he or she is a
reluctant seeker or does not seek enough, he or she is called a
non-seeker; if he or she is not faithful in all things, he or she is
called a departed one. All of this is correct in the sense that there is
a downfall in every sin, although we often soften our words about the
sins of others in order not to hurt peopleâ€™s feelings or our own. This
can be compared to the absolute necessity to hit the target  &ndash; if you
miss even a little bit, it isâ€¦ still a miss and you donâ€™t hit the
targetâ€¦ Whether a shooter is good or not can be seen by how close he or
she hits the <q>ten</q>, but if the question is: <q>ten</q> or something else,
even a <q>9</q> (which is almost the best result in other circumstances) will
be a miss. All the quoted psalms are in the same sense.</p>
<p>At first, this may look like something too demanding of a person. But
if we imagine a different situation  &ndash; not all sins are a downfall, there
are <q>not worth of fear</q>, <q>insignificant</q>, <q>not worthy of attention</q> sins
(I think you can see the logic and the train of thought further), then
the very concept of sin loses its real meaning, and a person can easily
<q>build compromises with conscience and God</q>.</p>
<p>No, but even a small sin is a sin and is important, it cannot be
simply neglected. Even a small lie is a lie, and moreover, from many
small lies, under certain conditions, a great deception can arise. And
so on. Thatâ€™s why there is such demandingness, but it is necessary.</p>
<p>One can also say that such demandingness <q>sharpens</q> every moment of
human existence, and this can give a tremendous depth of meaning to
every moment, at least some of them.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VI, 31-34; VII, 9-11) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew VI, 34  &ndash; â€˜ÎºÎ±ÎºÎ¹Î±â€™  &ndash; â€˜kakiaâ€™ -
(to the day its) â€˜evil, badâ€™.</p>
<p>The first part of chapter VI is about the anxieties and troubles of
life, and the second part is about asking God in prayer.</p>
<p>There is a good essay on the former here:
