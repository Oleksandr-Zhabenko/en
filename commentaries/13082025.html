it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XVI, 4-12) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XVI, 7 — 'ἐν παρόδῳ' - 'en parodo' - <q>in passing through; in passing by</q>. When.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 8 — 'ἐν Ἐφέσῳ' - 'en Epheso' - <q>in Ephesus</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 11 — 'ἐν εἰρήνῃ' - 'en eirene' - <q>in peace</q>. That is how. See about peace a good verse at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDr3toZNcd2/">https://www.instagram.com/p/DDr3toZNcd2/</a>
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XVI, 12 — 'ευκαιρηση' - 'eukairese' - <q>will have a good opportunity, good time, free time</q>.
</p>
<p>
Generally a reading about Paul's plans and his closest co-workers concerning visits to the Corinthians. From the point of view of faith, an instructive text concerning that it is expedient to take into account various circumstances, particularly time and opportunity.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew XXI, 28-32) </reading><br>
Matthew XXI, 28 — 'ἐν τῷ ἀμπελῶνι' - 'en to ampeloni' - <q>in the vineyard</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 31 — 'τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο' - 'tis ek ton duo' - <q>who of these two</q>. The preposition 'ek' here indicates choice from a group of two people. 'εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ' - 'eis ten basileian tou theou' - <q>into the Kingdom of God</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 32 — 'ἐν ὁδῷ δικαιοσύνης' - 'en hodo dikaiosynes' - <q>in the way of righteousness; with the way of righteousness</q>. Rather the second variant, since it is more comprehensible grammatically. Indicates the manner of action, how.
</p>
<p>
The parable about two sons. By sons are understood different people who have two different attitudes to God's will, the will of the Father.
</p>
<p>
The question <q>Who fulfilled?</q> concerns the final result, since precisely it was decisive. In the parable the agreement / disagreement in the sons is connected with so-called self-identification of a person — how a person connects themselves with God, and how much this is important for them in their eyes. Agreement means that a person considers themselves believing and pious, to some extent this matters for them, they themselves perceive themselves as such. And disagreement — on the contrary — means that a person themselves does not want to connect themselves with God, at least at some stage of their life, that is departs from God and moves towards sin or directly in sins.
</p>
<p>
Instead here further we see the importance of repentance. Sinful people who departed from God and did not consider themselves righteous and pious, turned many through the preaching of John the Baptist, the preaching of repentance, but those who considered themselves pious and righteous did not want to do this, their own self-assessment hindered them. Instead they received a second call to repentance — through seeing by them the conversion of obviously sinful people, but even that they did not want to do themselves, because they did not want to see their sins. And therefore in the end, what will encourage them to repentance? And if God's will is precisely repentance, because all are sinful, then therefore they did not fulfil God's will.
</p>
<p>
I will note that from the parable IN NO WAY follows the thought that for salvation it is better first to be a sinful person. Yes, in the parable sinful people repented. But for this was needed the preaching of John the Baptist (in history — a unique case, but more generally, was needed a substantial push to repentance). And if a person does not feel such a push? If sin generally closes their vision? Then their state is even worse than that of their who agreed but did not go.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the parable teaches primarily repentance, teaches to be open to conversion and repentance (not to seek some special pushes), and also humility — truthful seeing of one's state and readiness for correction. By this the parable is similar to another place from the Gospel, about which was spoken at the links:<br>
