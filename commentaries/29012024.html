<meta name="description" content="'from the little ones to the great' - an indication that the little ones will know the Lord, something that not everyone has now. This is an implicit and indirect reference to the salvation of some non-Christians, who are mostly called little ones - in this age, in particular now, they need knowledge of God, enlightenment, but in the future age, in the Kingdom of God, those who will be saved will have pure knowledge of God. And the great ones are the faithful who will be saved, and they will also have a pure knowledge of God; we can expect that there will be a difference between the states of these people, as Paul writes in another Epistle. The Apostle Paul takes an extended and precise quotation from the book of Jeremiah - in the Hebrew text it is Jeremiah XXXI, 31-34, in the Greek Septuagint it is Jeremiah XXXVIII, 31-34 (the Greek and Hebrew texts of the book of Jeremiah differ considerably, in particular in the order of the chapters, but this quotation is the same in both). Apparently, he also often used these words in discussions with Jews about the commandments of Christ. Another important point from the prophecy is that the fulfilment of the New Testament commandments requires knowledge of God. And those who do not know the true God cannot be grounded in the New Testament commandments, even if they can sometimes act accordingly by God's grace. It also indicates how they are to be fulfilled - through faith in Christ, through love for God and people, etc. Any other fulfilment does not fit the quote and is 'imperfect', so to speak. It should also be noted that the reference is to the fulfilment of all the commandments, not just part of them or just some of them. Reference to other commentaries.">

Hebrews VIII, 8 &mdash; '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±Œπ' - 'emerai' - 'days'. 'œÉœÖŒΩœÑŒµŒªŒ≠œÉœâ' - 'synteleso' - 'I will accomplish, fulfil, make complete, perfect, reaching the goal'.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VIII, 9 &mdash; '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥' - 'emera' - 'day'. '·º†ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒ∑œÉŒ±' - 'emelesa' - 'I will neglect, I will not take the necessary care' - from '·ºÄŒºŒµŒªŒ≠œâ'.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews VIII, 10 &mdash; '·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ' - 'emeras' - 'days'. 
</p>
<p>
<q>From the little ones to the great</q> &mdash; an indication that even the little ones will know the Lord, something that not everyone has now. This is an implicit and indirect reference to the salvation of some non-Christians, who are mostly called little ones - in this age, in particular now, they need knowledge of God, enlightenment, but in the future age, in the Kingdom of God, those who will be saved will have pure knowledge of God. And the great ones are the faithful who will be saved, and they will also have a pure knowledge of God; we can expect that there will be a difference between the states of these people, as Paul writes in another Epistle.

The Apostle Paul takes an extended and precise quotation from the book of Jeremiah &mdash; in the Hebrew text it is Jeremiah XXXI, 31-34, in the Greek Septuagint it is Jeremiah XXXVIII, 31-34 (the Greek and Hebrew texts of the book of Jeremiah differ considerably, in particular in the order of the chapters, but this quotation is the same in both).

</p>
<p>
It also indicates how they are to be fulfilled &mdash; through faith in Christ, through love for God and people, etc. Any other fulfilment does not fit the quote and is <q>imperfect</q>, so to speak. It should also be noted that it is a question of fulfilling all the commandments, not just a part of them or just some of them.
