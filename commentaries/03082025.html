Matins:<br>
<reading>(John XX, 11-18 ) </reading><br>
More about the reading from the Gospel see at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25052025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/25052025.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians I, 10-18 ) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians I, 10, 11 — 'ἐν ὑμῖν' - 'en hymin' - <q>in you; among you; amongst you</q>. 'κατηρρισμενοι' - 'katerrismenoi' - <q>were in the best state, were perfected in their best states, applications</q>. 'ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ νοῒ' - 'en to auto noi' - <q>in one mind; of one thinking</q>. 'ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ γνώμῃ' - 'en te aute gnome' - <q>in one thought; of one mind</q>. That is, Paul warns against divisions, teaches (asks for) unity of mind, and in this — differences, and in this — the best development together.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians I, 11 — 'ὑπὸ τῶν Χλόης' - 'hypo ton KHloes' - <q>through those of Chloe</q> (Chloe is a name). The preposition 'hypo' with genitive case here emphasises that Chloe's people simply spread the information.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians I, 13 — 'εἰς τὸ ὄνομα' - 'eis to onoma' - <q>into the name</q>. The preposition 'eis' also indicates that actions in someone's name are called to bring closer to the one whose name it is. For example, to do something in God's name — to try to unite through this with God.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians I, 15 — 'εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα' - 'eis to emon onoma' - <q>into my name</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians I, 17 — 'ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου' - 'en sophia logou' - <q>in wisdom of word; with wisdom of word</q>. Both translations are correct, although the second looks more understandable.
</p>
<p>
Since those who divided amongst themselves in such a way completely forgot and neglected the foundations of faith, Paul reminds them of them. Judging by Paul's words, it even came to thoughts that the person of the one who baptises becomes a peculiar <q>key</q> to further salvation — the Corinthians in disputes began to think that the question of who exactly baptised them was more important than common faith and unity of the Church. Of course, Paul denies this, quite in an emotional way.
</p>
<p>
Paul clearly distinguishes the important from the secondary. If Christ had called Paul precisely to baptise, then he would not thank God (here he applies an extremely emotional counter-argument to the thoughts of the Corinthians, probably this was the best way to stop them from divisions) that he baptised almost no one. But since this was not the main thing in his ministry, he is ready to show Christian flexibility.
</p>
<p>
The word in verse 18 comes from 'μωραινω' — 'moraino' - <q>to be (make) unreasonable; to be (make) such that has become stale, weathered; to be such that has lost taste; gullible; trusting, naive</q>. People who do not accept the preaching about the Cross of the Lord, about His Crucifixion, consider that this is naivety, gullibility. Instead, one can say the opposite — that actually human wisdom, which has not known God's, before God <q>has lost taste</q>, people have become <q>gullible</q> (believe in what is easy to believe). God's faith is different.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Matthew XIV, 14-22) </reading><br>
Matthew XIV, 15 — 'εἰς τὰς κώμας' - 'eis tas komas' - <q>into the villages; through the villages</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIV, 19 — 'εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν' - 'eis ton ouranon' - <q>into the sky; to the heaven</q>. Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIV, 21 — 'χωρὶς γυναικῶν καὶ παιδίων' - 'khoris gynaikon kai paidion' - (if counting) <q>separately from women and children; without women and children</q>. Both variants of translation are appropriate here.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XIV, 22 — 'εἰς τὸ πλοῖον' - 'eis to ploion' - <q>into the ship; into the boat; to the ship; to the boat</q>. Where to. 'εἰς τὸ πέραν' - 'eis to peran' - <q>there, across; to the other side</q>. A common expression which is translated by the second phrase. Where to.
</p>
<p>
The Lord did not send the crowds away with nothing. An example of miraculous God's care for people.
</p>
<p>
The miracle of feeding a multithousand crowd with several loaves and fish significantly surpasses a similar miracle of the prophet Elisha, shows the Divine dignity of Jesus.
</p>
<p>
Also the miracle in a peculiar way shows that God is simultaneously economical and generous. Economical — because He fed people with a small quantity of initial food, and generous — because He fed in full measure, generously, abundantly. In a similar way God's grace also often acts — God gives it generously, simultaneously in a certain measure.
