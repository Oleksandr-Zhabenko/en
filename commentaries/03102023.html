<p><reading>(Ephesians V, 20-26) </reading>
</p>
<p>Ephesians V, 20  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’
(our).</p>
<p>This reading is preceded by an important and profound passage, which
is well reviewed here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid0BebXWWfbrKvPbyDGuV7cnRX1uVNyCZZ67HERiXydJTi1NS8Vds262XQ6zc4sQV1tl">https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/</a></p>
<p><q>The fear of Christ</q> is the fear of grieving God through sin, of
grieving Jesus Christ. More about the fear of God is well written here:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul encourages us to be grateful and thankful to
God.</p>
<p>Then Paul writes about love among Christians. It includes humility, a
true vision of oneself. And then he writes about the life of a married
couple. Marriage in the Lord is a Mystery, a Sacrament, and has a deep
meaning, and Paul here likens it to the union of Christ and the Church.
There is also a continuation about mutual humility. Many people pay
attention to the fact that a woman should be humble in relation to her
husband. But not everyone pays attention to the fact that a husband, if
he is like Christ, it means that he should sacrifice himself for his
wife, just as Christ gave Himself for the salvation of the Church by
crucifixion and death on the cross. The husband is thus called to no
less humility than the wife by this comparison. In other words, we need
to understand that Paul is talking about the mutual humility of the
spouses, about mutual agreement, about harmony and mutual understanding.
I also wrote on this topic from a different perspective in another place
in Paul’s Epistles:
<br><a class="link2" href="27072023.html">27072023.html</a></p>

<p><reading>(Luke VI, 37-45) </reading>
</p>
<p>Luke VI, 39  &ndash; ‘εμπεσουνται’  &ndash; ‘empesountai’  &ndash; ‘will
fall’.</p>
<p>A continuation of the Sermon on the Mount in Luke. He presents here
the words of Christ that Matthew gives in different places.</p>
<p>There are good commentaries on verses 37-42 in relation to the
parallel passage in Matthew (Matthew VII, 1-5) at the following links:

<br><a class="link2" href="04072023.html">04072023.html</a></p>
<p>Verse 39 regarding the parallel passage (Matthew XV, 14) is written
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="20072023.html">20072023.html</a></p>
<p>Verse 40 regarding the parallel passage (Matthew X, 24) is written
about here:
<br><a class="link2" href="22062023.html">22062023.html</a></p>
<p>For the verses on the fruit in the parallel passage (Matthew VII,
16-20), see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="13062023.html">13062023.html</a></p>
<p>Also, regarding the parallel passage to verses 43-45 (Matthew XII,
33-35), see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="29072023.html">29072023.html</a></p>

<p>To the Saint Hieromartyr Dionysius the Areopagite: (Acts XVII, 16-34;
Matthew XIII, 44-54) Acts XVII, 17, 31  &ndash; ‘ημεραν’  &ndash; ‘emeran’  &ndash; ‘day’
((every) day, day).</p>
<p>The reading from the Apostle is preceded by the one referred to here:
<br><a class="link2" href="22052023.html">22052023.html</a></p>
<p>For the majority of the reading from the Apostle (verses 19-28), see
here:
<br><a class="link2" href="23052023.html">23052023.html</a></p>
<p>Also, for the distinction between sacrifices to God and to idols,
which relate to demons, see here:
<br><a class="link2" href="26072023.html">26072023.html</a></p>
<p>I also wrote in detail about an important theological place (verses
26-29, which relate to the creation of people, the origin of peoples and
their settlement) here:
<br><a class="link2" href="09032023.html">09032023.html</a></p>
<p>The reading directly mentions Saint Dionysius the Areopagite and his
conversion, so this is the place to read.</p>
