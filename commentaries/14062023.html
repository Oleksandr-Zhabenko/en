<p><reading>(Romans IV, 13-25) </reading>
</p>
<p>Continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading:
<br><a class="link2" href="13062023.html">13062023.html</a></p>
<p>As for Abrahamâ€™s body, this refers to the birth of Isaac, the heir of
promise, to him and Sarah.</p>
<p>Verse 14 implies that if the Law, and not faith, takes precedence
over the promise, then the subsequent ordinances of the Law are of
greater importance than the promise and faith, and thus they would be
<q>as if they were unnecessary</q>. But not so  &ndash; faith and promise are more
important than the Law and precede it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Law is also from God, which is why Abraham is
called <q>the father of many nations</q> and where Godâ€™s generosity is also
evident.</p>
<p>As for the comparison between Abrahamâ€™s faith and the faith of
Christians, in the time of the Apostle Paul, Christianity was not
widespread, not traditional, and everyone believed in their freedom,
just as Abraham believed, although according to human reasoning and
standards, he should not have believed in it. But even now, the deep
faith of Christians is not just a tradition or common to many.
Therefore, the comparison, although times have changed, remains entirely
valid. Indeed, faith in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the faith
of Abraham are similar.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew VII, 21-23) </reading>
</p>
<p>Matthew VII, 23  &ndash; â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™  &ndash; â€˜emouâ€™  &ndash; (from)
â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>A continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading, with verse 21 read on two
consecutive days. See this link for more information:
<br><a class="link2" href="13062023.html">13062023.html</a></p>
<p>Matthew VII, 22  &ndash; in the original, <q>Your name</q> is in the dative case.
In ancient Greek, there was no ablative case; its functions were
performed by other cases, including the dative. So the literal
translation of <q>Is not (to or by) Your name?</q> remains multivalent. It
can mean the same as the traditional translation in the ablative case,
but it can also indicate that people thought that their actions would
bring glory and honour to the name of Christ. If they (in parallel,
unrepentantly) committed lawlessness, i.e., went against Godâ€™s will, in
particular, and above all, against Godâ€™s revealed and known will, then
they did not bring glory to Christ, but they are not like Moses either
(the Law of Moses says of him that the Lord <q>knows him by name</q>). I
wrote about a similar line of thought in relation to 3 John:
<br><a class="link2" href="20022023.html">20022023.html</a></p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord calls everyone to repentance. He came <q>to know
and to save that which was lost</q>.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
