it is written that the use of prepositions is important for the correct understanding of important and actual issues, in particular the issue of power, I am writing commentaries on the use of these prepositions. As a piece of advice on how to read the text, you can read the verse in translation and/or in the original (if you have the opportunity), and then the commentary on prepositions here. Next, you need to understand which part of the verse the commentary refers to, and consider what it affirms — or less often, denies — that is essential to understanding. This thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects against the mistakes mentioned above.

<reading>(1 Timothy V, 1-10) </reading><br>
1 Timothy V, 2 &mdash; ‘ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνείᾳ’ - ‘en pase agneia’ - ‘in all purity; with all purity’. The former is more likely, since it is not clear what the latter is supposed to mean.
</p>
<p>
1 Timothy V, 10 &mdash; ‘ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς’ - ‘en ergois kalois’ - ‘in good (beautiful) deeds; with good (beautiful) deeds’. Both translations are possible, the first indicating that there should be evidence of her good deeds, and the second that the deeds themselves testify to the person.

</p>
<p>
<reading>(Mark X, 46-52) </reading><br>
Mark X, 46 &mdash; ‘εἰς Ἰερειχώ’ - ‘eis Iereikho’ - ’into Jericho’. ‘ἀπὸ Ἰερειχὼ’ - ‘apo Iereikho’ - ‘from Jericho’. The preposition ‘apo’ indicates that they were leaving Jericho. ‘παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν’ - ‘para ten hodon’ - ‘to the proximity with the road; near the road’. The preposition ‘para’ here is with the accusative, indicating that he was sitting by the road.
</p>
<p>
Mark X, 52 &mdash; ‘ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ’ - ‘en te hode’ - ‘on the road’.
