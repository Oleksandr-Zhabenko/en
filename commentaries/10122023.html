Luke 17:13 &mdash; 'á¼¡Î¼á¾¶Ï‚' - 'emas' - 'us'.
</p>
<p>
Jesus' healing of ten people with leprosy. Jesus fulfils the Law of Moses and encourages the lepers to do the same, but the fulfilment of the Law is based on their faith in Christ. It is with this faith that salvation comes. But this same faith motivates one of them not only to fulfil the necessary requirements of the Law, but to go further and return to give glory to God, that is, to glorify Christ and God through Him. And it is precisely this kind of faith, which <q>goes further</q> &mdash; up to the knowledge of God Himself - that saves the healed leper.
</p>
<p>
It should also be noted, as the commentators note, that <q>your faith</q> implicitly means <q>the One in Whom one believes</q>, i.e. Christ Himself. Not faith itself as a state, but the One to Whom it is addressed. For it is not the state or works that save a person, but Christ Himself, the Lord Himself. And even the name of Jesus &mdash; <q>the Lord is salvation</q> - clearly says that it is not faith that saves, but the Lord Himself, in Whom one believes.
</p>
<p>
It is also an example of the fact that a miracle of God is not enough for salvation, because salvation in its own sense is needed not by a state of affairs, a situation, or even the state of body of a sick person, etc., but by the person themselves, personally, holistically, and therefore even a manifestation of God's glory, God's action, God's grace, God's gift &mdash; if the person does not unite with this, it does not lead them to salvation. But if they do, then it leads them.
</p>
<p>
We also see here a lesson in gratitude, in particular for God's blessings.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
