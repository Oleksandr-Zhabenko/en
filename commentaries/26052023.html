<p>(Acts XIX, 1-8)</p>
<p>Acts XIX, 3 - there is literally a certain duality of meaning: <q>Into
what (as a destination) were you baptised / fully immersed?</q> - <q>Into
Johnâ€™s baptism / full immersion</q>. In other words, the form of the
Sacrament of Baptism symbolises <q>full immersion</q> (the literal original
meaning of the word â€˜Î²Î±Ï€Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼Î±â€™) into the Holy Spirit, where the Spirit
is symbolically represented (<q>depicted</q>, although this is not the most
appropriate word here) by water. Immersion in water symbolises the entry
into spiritual life from the Spirit, just as bodily birth represents the
<q>full entry of the infant into the world</q>, i.e.Â the Sacrament of Baptism
is a spiritual birth, a birth from the Spirit.</p>
<p>Acts XIX, 4 - Johnâ€™s baptism is not an actual Sacrament, but is
called the <q>baptism of repentance</q>, that is, it is <q>complete immersion
in repentance</q>, in fact, it symbolically presents complete
repentance.</p>
<p>Acts XIX, 5 - <q>Baptism in the name of Jesus</q> - <q>complete immersion in
the name of Jesus</q> - that is, becoming fully Christian, is synonymous
with the Sacrament of Baptism. The form of the Sacrament even then was
Baptism in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit - see the end of the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p>Acts XIX, 6 - the laying on of hands by Paul - is the initial form of
the Sacrament of Anointing.</p>
<p>An important reading for understanding the relationship between the
Sacraments and Johnâ€™s baptism.</p>
<p>(John XIV, 1-11)</p>
<p>John XIV, 1, 9 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Îµâ€™ - â€˜emeâ€™ - â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John XIV, 3, 6, 9, 10 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…â€™ - â€˜emautouâ€™ - â€˜Myselfâ€™. â€˜ÎµÎ¹Î¼Î¹â€™ -
â€˜eimiâ€™ - (I) â€˜amâ€™. Used for emphasis. â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Ï…â€™ - â€˜emouâ€™ - (through)
â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>John XIV, 10, 11 - â€˜ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹â€™ - â€˜emoiâ€™ - (in) â€˜Meâ€™.</p>
<p>Part of the dialogue between Jesus and the apostles at the Last
Supper after they had communed with the Body and Blood of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>The main subject is the unity of Jesus and the Father, as well as
coming to the Father through the Son.</p>
<p>The word <q>way</q> (<q>path</q>) is used in two different senses - when Jesus
explicitly calls Himself this way, it refers to His meaning for
salvation. And when He says that <q>you know the way</q>, the way refers to
the Gospel commandments, teachings, and the way believers in Christ
should live.</p>
<p>Again, as before, it is clear that cognition of one of the Persons of
the Trinity is possible only through the mediation of the Other. I have
written about this several times, see, in particular, the following
link:
<br><a class="link2" href="04052023.html">04052023.html</a><br></p>
<p>Jesus simultaneously teaches new things, but also confirms the
previous ones. In fact, in this regard, it can be assumed that the
earlier teachings made to the disciples were also intended to enable
them to understand Jesus better now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the apostles did not understand everything, they did
not understand very much, but they had it all memorised.</p>
<p>The Lord wisely teaches the disciples to know God.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
