it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.<br>
The correct statements in the work at the link:<br>

are connected with comments written during more than a year, during which I better understood the ideas, usage, logic, even peculiarities of pronunciation, therefore now it is appropriate to review and correct the allowed inaccuracies. Instead of correcting in old texts, I will correct in new ones (I have already begun to do this). Therefore the work continues, particularly it is necessary to consider the readings during about two weeks in August-September 2024, when I did not have access to the Internet network. If you notice inaccuracies in the comments at the links cited there, then it is worth checking whether there are newer ones regarding the same reading. I will update the list of links regarding prepositions at the link:<br>

Liturgy:<br>
<reading>(1 Corinthians XV, 12-19) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians XV, 12 — &#39;ἐγήγερται ἐκ νεκρῶν&#39; - &#39;egegertai ek nekron&#39; - <q>has been raised from the dead</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here means from where Jesus has risen — from the dead. &#39;ἐν ὑμῖν&#39; - &#39;en hymin&#39; - <q>among you; between you</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 17 — &#39;ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις&#39; - &#39;en tais hamartiais&#39; - <q>in sins</q>. In what.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 18, 19 — &#39;ἐν Χριστῷ&#39; - &#39;en CHristo&#39; - <q>in Christ</q>.
</p>
<p>
1 Corinthians XV, 19 — &#39;ἐν τῇ ζωῇ ταύτῃ&#39; - &#39;en te zoe taute&#39; - <q>in this life</q>. That is in the present state, which is susceptible to sins, sufferings, diseases, corruption and death.
</p>
<p>
Based on the truth and reality of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, Paul confirms the truth of the teaching about the general resurrection of the dead. A rare example of logical syllogisms in Scripture. It must be said that many Corinthians were educated, knew philosophy and logic, therefore Paul reasons as a philosopher or logician here. In particular he uses the logical law <q>If from A follows B, then from not B follows not A</q> and the law of double negation: <q>not (not C) equals C</q>. Here A — <q>the dead do not rise</q>, B — <q>Christ has not risen</q>, and C — concerns simultaneously two different statements — <q>Christ has risen</q> and <q>the dead rise</q>. That is Paul <q>proves a theological theorem</q>, which means that there exists such a phenomenon as resurrection of the dead, of which the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is an example and confirmation. However, it must be understood that purely logically proven is only its existence (if a person believes in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ), but not universality and not necessity. About the universality of resurrection of all the dead and about its obligation we learn from faith, from God&#39;s Revelation, and not from logic.
</p>
<p>
Further Paul continues to use the same laws of logic already for another question — salvation of people and forgiveness of sins (similar reasoning, with the difference that Paul goes from the negation of Christ&#39;s Resurrection, and then shows that these reasonings are false, because Christ has risen).
</p>
<p>
Verse 19 shows that faith in the resurrection of the dead and eternal life is an essential and inseparable component of faith in Christ, that is Christianity.

<reading>(Matthew XXI, 18-22) </reading><br>
Matthew XXI, 18 — &#39;εἰς τὴν πόλιν&#39; - &#39;eis ten polin&#39; - <q>to the city</q> (Jerusalem). Where to.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 19 — &#39;ἐν αὐτῇ&#39; - &#39;en aute&#39; - <q>in it; on it</q>. Actually, in English the second variant grammatically. Where. &#39;ἐκ σοῦ&#39; - &#39;ek sou&#39; - <q>from you; out of you</q>. The preposition &#39;ek&#39; here indicates origin. &#39;εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα&#39; - &#39;eis ton aiona&#39; - <q>for ever; for ages</q>. Common expression.
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 21 — &#39;εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν&#39; - &#39;eis ten thalassan&#39; -  <q>into the sea; to the sea</q>. The preposition &#39;eis&#39; here indicates movement. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew XXI, 22 — &#39;ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ&#39; - &#39;en te proseukhe&#39; - <q>in (high, inspired) prayer</q>.
