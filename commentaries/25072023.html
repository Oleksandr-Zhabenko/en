<p><reading>(1 Corinthians X, 5-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>The apostle Paul writes that the events of
the Old Testament became prototypes and teachings for his contemporary
Christians, and it is better to understand them as such for all
Christians, because the end times last from the First Coming of Christ
until the Second Coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Many researchers believe that what happened in the Old Testament
bodily, in the New Testament happens mainly spiritually  &ndash; for example,
if someone died bodily because of serious sins, in the New Testament it
happens to the soul of such a person  &ndash; they die spiritually, drifting
away from God. We can say that this sequence corresponds to the way
small children learn to be compassionate to the pain of other people and
animals: first they learn to recognise someoneâ€™s bodily pain through
visible and noticeable signs, and then they learn to be compassionate to
the pain of the soul, which may not be expressed as visibly as the
bodily pain.</p>
<p>Here Paul also lists some well-known examples from the Old Testament
with the idea that they should teach Christians about being faithful to
God in various forms (Paul lists some).</p>
<p>I note that living solely for the sake of material pleasures is
equated here with idolatry, because such a life puts the material in the
place of God. Modern people are often not inclined to think this way,
but we need to understand that if a person lives for the sake of
material things, then the meaning of their life, in their opinion, is
reduced to this, and this is also their goal. They then neglect what
they were actually created for â€” to be eternally happy in love with God.
They are then, to a certain extent, <q>ruled</q> (determined by their
thoughts, views, feelings, behaviour, etc.) by the material world, and
we can say that they serve it to a certain extent. Then the idea that
this can be called idolatry, according to Paul, becomes closer to modern
people, more accessible to understanding.</p>
<p>Christians need to remember their vocation.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XVI, 6-12) </reading>
</p>
<p>A direct continuation of yesterdayâ€™s reading,
which described in more detail what is included in that <q>leaven</q>. It
must be said that the question of the sign is only part of what we need
to watch out for, but it is a very eloquent part. The examples of the
miracles of feeding people show that Christ loves bread, including
leavened bread, and speaks of spirituality. The disciplesâ€™ understanding
was literal and material. See more here:
