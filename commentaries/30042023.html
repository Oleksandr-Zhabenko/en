<p>(Acts VI, 1-7) Acts VI, 1 - <q>neglected</q> - <q>not given due attention</q>;
<q>ministry</q> - literally: <q>waiting at the tables</q>, also <q>ministry</q></p>
<p>Acts VI, 2 - the word used is literally translated as <q>to leave
behind, to neglect, to cease to pay attention to</q>.</p>
<p>Acts VI, 5 - according to Orthodox tradition, all the first deacons,
except the seventh, are glorified saints among the 70 apostles.</p>
<p>In general, the passage is important because it describes the
emergence of one of the ranks of the clergy in the Church, the deacons.
The original functions of these first deacons were somewhat different
from those that later deacons would fulfil, but they were generally the
same. The text says nothing about the deaconesses who also appeared
later, whose ministry literally corresponded to helping at tables. They
are now in the Patriarchate of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The 12 senior apostles, on the other hand, were more engaged in
<q>integrative</q> functions, they cared more about the unity of the Church
and the faithful in faith and grace.</p>
<p>(Mark XV, 43 - XVI, 8; the rest of Chapter XVI was read at the
morning service) In connection with the memory of the saints
myrrh-bearing women, the righteous Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus,
the Gospel of Mark is read, not of John. It contains the most details
about the events remembered today.</p>
<p>Joseph showed courage in going to Pilate. <q>Courage</q> is a word used
here that means <q>objective</q> rather than <q>subjective</q> courage, that is,
in fact, not in Josephâ€™s own feelings and attitudes. This word glorifies
his action: he was indeed taking a great risk with his conversion - he
could have been executioned in the worst case scenario (or at least
fallen into disgrace). The Gospel emphasises Josephâ€™s true heroism with
this word. The word probably comes from a word that means <q>purpose,
goal</q> and thus denotes courage and boldness that come from extreme
commitment to a goal, purpose, devotion.</p>
<p>Linen clothing - has long been famous for its antibacterial
properties, and was worn by priests as a sign of resistance and purity
from sin.</p>
<p>Mark XVI, 3 - <q>roll away the stone</q> - the stone was too large and
rolled away to be moved by people.</p>
<p>Mark XVI, 5 - <q>a long valuable garment</q> worn by the upper classes in
the East as a sign of dignity.</p>
<p>Mark XVI, 8 - <q>they were seized with trembling and their minds were
exceedingly overwhelmed, they were out of their minds</q> - is a
descriptive, more literal translation. That is, they were extremely
overwhelmed by feelings and emotions. It should be emphasised that this
state occurred after they had left the tomb, when they were trying to
realise what had happened. They saw the angel in the empty tomb with
great amazement, but their feelings were much less involved then, but
when they began to understand what had happened, they were <q>shocked</q> by
the absolute complete non-expectation, the unexpectedness, which is why
they were so moved and why they did not say anything.</p>
<p>Other evangelists, such as John the Theologian, report further
events, including Mary Magdalene returning to the tomb once again, where
Jesus Himself revealed Himself to her. The women also realised what had
happened and told the apostles in the morning of the same day.</p>
<p>Thus, these women became <q>apostles to the apostles</q>, and the greeting
of St Mary Magdalene, my beloved saint woman, <q>Christ is Risen!</q> became
a common greeting at Easter.</p>
<p>I would like to say a few more words about the Myrrh-Bearing Women,
Joseph and Nicodemus. All of them are some of my beloved saints, in
particular Mary Magdalene is a beloved saint woman, as well as Martha
and Mary, the sisters of Lazarus, and Nicodemus is one of my beloved
saints men.</p>
<p>According to tradition, they all went to be with the Lord peacefully,
and they were not martyred at the end of their lives. I think this is so
because they suffered in their souls during the Passion of Jesus Christ.
<q>Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you
from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test
those who dwell on the earth.</q> (Revelation III:10). If the Lord promises
to save these people from temptation at the end of the world for keeping
the word of His Passion, it is quite clear that He has already done so
with those who not only kept the word, but also witnessed and showed
love and faithfulness with their very lives.</p>
<p>I will not write more about their lives now, because there is too
much to say, but I will mention them in the time of their memory.</p>
<p>I wish all women and the faithful that they may always serve as
examples of goodness and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
