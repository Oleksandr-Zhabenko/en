<p><reading>(Isaiah XI, 10  &ndash; XII, 2) </reading>
</p>
<p>The well-known prophecy about the <q>Root of
Jesse</q> — Christ.</p>
<p>Again, there is multi-planning regarding time — that is, the giving
of Christ to humanity already happened in time, but ultimately all the
fruits of the Coming of the Son of God will be after the Second
Coming.</p>
<p>It ends with a prophecy about the Name of Jesus and that He is the
Savior. The angel told Joseph and Mary to name the God-baby as Jesus,
which means <q>Lord is salvation.</q></p>

<p><reading>(Genesis VII, 11  &ndash; VIII, 3) </reading>
</p>
<p>The flood, the extermination of the
inhabitants of the earth, the rescue of those in the ark.</p>
<p>In general, a summary of the flood can be found at the link:
<br><a class="link2" href="https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc-1">https://parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/hrystyyanstvo-virovchennya-ta-tradytsiji/zakon-bozhyj/chastyna-tretya-svyaschenna-istoriya-staroho-ta-novoho-zavitu/#toc-1</a></p>
<p>The issue of <q>universality</q> of the flood is unclear. There are people
who consider that the flood was only on the part of the Earth’s surface
known to Moses (or people of that time), but there are also those who
consider it really <q>worldwide</q> in the modern sense (all over the
Earth).</p>
<p><q>every creature that has the breath of life</q> — both humans and
animals.</p>
<p>But at the creation of the world, the <q>breath of life</q> (<q>spirit of
life</q>) is spoken exclusively in relation to human. One might think that
the very human breath of life is important, since human life includes
the life of an intelligent immortal soul, and human is created in the
image of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>In general, the question of the life of animal souls remains unclear.
Most agree that animals have a <q>living soul</q>, but an <q>unintelligent</q> one (not in the sense of devoid of thinking, but in the sense of one in which soul's analogues of mental processes do not lead to significant changes in existence as beings, as we see in people  &ndash; added 2023-03-16 11:34 PM EET),
not endowed with the image of God, and there is a difference of opinion
as to whether animal souls die and (if it is the case, then) how it
happens.</p>
<p>In particular, King Solomon in one of his books asks about the fate
of an animal’s soul after its death and does not have a clear
answer.</p>
<p>The Law of Moses says that the soul of an animal is in its blood, why
the blood had to be poured out and not eaten. But if you eat animals,
then they are already dead at that moment, and therefore, the soul <q>as
life force</q> of the body does not make sense to exist in the blood after
death, if it is only <q>life force</q>. At the same time, it does not make
sense to exist in the blood of animals as a part of the body, because
the soul is not a component of the body.</p>
<p>Therefore, in view of this, one can think that the <q>breath of life</q>
in relation to animals is not the same as the <q>breath of life</q> in
relation to human. Both come from God, both give life, but in animals,
life is bodily, and in humans, moreover, it is valuable, human, even
eternal.</p>
<p>The existence of the tree of life in Paradise makes me think that
after the general Resurrection, the <q>breath of life</q> of people will also
be different, will change for the better, but I do not find any clear
indications as to exactly how.</p>
<p>There are people who wonder if there will be a resurrection of dead
animals (at least those that were loved by some people, pets, as a
manifestation of God’s love), but in general there is no clear
indication in the Scriptures that there will be a resurrection of
(chosen) animals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many ambiguities and questions.</p>

<p><reading>(Proverbs X, 1-22) </reading>
</p>
<p>The Greek and Hebrew texts differ here as
well.</p>
<p>Teachings are different, in the form of a thesis-comparison that
confirms the thesis.</p>
<p>It is interesting that at the time of Jesus Christ there was a trend
in Judaism, the ascetic tradition of the Essenes. They also often
considered the <q>two ways of life</q>—the righteous life and the unrighteous
life.</p>
<p>It can be thought that, in general, Solomon significantly influenced
the understanding of the world, including such comparisons.</p>
<p>You can clearly see some parallels with the Gospel.</p>
<p>For example, the verse of Proverbs X, 19 is directly reminiscent of
Matthew VI, 7-8.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
