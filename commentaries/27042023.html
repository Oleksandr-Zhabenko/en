<p><reading>(Acts IV, 23-31) </reading>
</p>
<p>The meaning of the passage is that the faithful
Christians, the apostles, seek God’s protection and help at a time when
people are fighting them through Christ, persecuting the Church and
continuing their persecution of Jesus Christ in His followers. The
faithful in prayer emphasise that these are only human schemes of those
sinful unrepentant people who are powerless against the Lord, who cannot
prevent the realisation of God’s salvation and the spread of faith and
the Church.</p>
<p>The quote is from Psalm II, 1-2; there is also a parallel with Isaiah
LXI, 1-4 ff. Isaiah is quoted in the Gospels at the beginning of Jesus’
ministry, when He opened the book of Isaiah and read this prophecy about
Himself.</p>
<p>After prayer, the faithful receive the gift of the Holy Spirit again,
this time for confirmation in preaching and in times of possible trials.
In the first appearance, there was a wind and a noise from heaven, and
in the second an earthquake. These are parallels to the appearance of
the Lord to the prophet Elijah at Horeb, when first a strong wind passed
before the face of God, then an earthquake, and then fire, and only then
the Lord Himself in a quiet, pleasant voice, who firmly strengthened
Elijah to continue his ministry. This parallel means that the faithful,
although not Christ themselves, are witnesses and testimony of His
glory, sent by Him into the world to preach, which Christ Himself
directs through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Acts IV, 25  &ndash; ‘εμελετησαν κενα’  &ndash; ‘emeletesan’  &ndash; is a derivative of
‘μελεταω’, the original meaning of which is ‘to care for’  &ndash; here in this
context it literally means ‘care for nothing, for vain things’,
i.e. they spend their energy on something that is useless to them. In
the Hebrew original of the quoted psalm there is <q>complain</q>, which can
also be translated as <q>think, ponder, meditate over</q>.</p>
<p>Acts IV, 28  &ndash; the word ‘προωρισεν’ is used, which is a form of
‘προοριζω’  &ndash; ‘to limit in advance’. No, the Lord did not <q>ordain</q> that
they should persecute and kill Jesus (then they would not have sinned,
see in particular more at the following links:

), but He limited their power so that they would not destroy the
believers with Jesus, and He is limiting them again so that they cannot
stop the preaching and destroy the believers. The Lord has limited the
evil done against Jesus, and now the believers ask for God’s further
protection (God’s limitation of the persecutors’ evil). See also what is
called the will here (following the same idea as the Apostle Peter in
his letters), good works at the following links:

<p>There is a good piece on courage and freedom in preaching here:

<p>In general, the resurrection of the dead is well written about at the
following links:

<p>John V, 30  &ndash; ‘εμη’  &ndash; ‘eme’  &ndash; ‘of Mine’ (in reference to judgement),
‘εμον’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘of Mine’ (in reference to will).</p>
<p>Christ, in speaking of judgement and will, means that He is the
impartial Judge and Executor of God’s (Father’s) will (which is also His
own as God, for it is inherent in God’s nature, and this nature of the
Father, Son and Spirit is one).</p>
<p>Since the will of God is also the will of the Son of God (one of the
two natural wills of Jesus Christ), the leading will (because the human
will of Jesus is obedient to the divine will of Jesus), the words <q>I do
not seek</q> and <q>I do</q> together mean that the Son of God treats the will
simply  &ndash; He does it (fulfils it). He does not argue with it, investigate
it, know it, try to understand it, or oppose it, but He knows it and
does it. This will of God is an expression of Himself, because the human
will of Jesus is obedient to it. He Himself is the truth, so He is
impartial (He has no need to take a position in advance regarding the
decision regarding any creation, as happens in the creation in the case
of bias, when the creation takes a position in advance). And God’s will
is that the creation freely should be with God in joy and love.</p>
<p>That is why Jesus is the Righteous Judge.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
