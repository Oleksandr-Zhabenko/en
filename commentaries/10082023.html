<p><reading>(2 Corinthians I, 1-7) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading of 2 Corinthians begins on a
weekday. From the text of the letter it becomes clear that there were
more letters to the Corinthians, this is not the second in order, but
only two of them have been preserved, of which this is the second. It is
a theologically rich letter (in fact, like all the others).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 3  &ndash; ‘οικτιρμων’  &ndash; ‘oiktirmon’  &ndash; ‘compassions,
pities’ (plural in the original).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 2-6  &ndash; ‘ημων’  &ndash; ‘emon’  &ndash; ‘us’ (our).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 3  &ndash; ‘παρακλησεος’  &ndash; ‘parakleseos’  &ndash; ‘consolation,
encouragement, comfort’. This word in its various forms is the key word
in today’s reading.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 4, 5  &ndash; ‘ημας’  &ndash; ‘emas’  &ndash; ‘us’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 4  &ndash; ‘παρακαλων’  &ndash; ‘parakalon’  &ndash; ‘comforts,
entreates, encourages’. ‘παρακαλειν’  &ndash; ‘parakalein’  &ndash; ‘to comfort, to be
able to comfort, to console, to encourage’. ‘παρακλησεος’ -
‘parakleseos’  &ndash; ‘comfort, consolation, entreaty, encouragement’.
‘παρακαλουμεθα’  &ndash; ‘parakaloumetha’  &ndash; ‘comforted, encouraged’ (the last
two words are repeated in verse 6, and the first one is also repeated in
verse 7).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 5  &ndash; ‘παρακλησις’  &ndash; ‘paraklesis’  &ndash; ‘comfort,
encouragement, exhortation’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 6  &ndash; ‘ημεις’  &ndash; ‘emeis’  &ndash; ‘we’.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians I, 7  &ndash; ‘κοινωνοι’  &ndash; ‘koinonoi’  &ndash; ‘partners,
partakers’.</p>
<p>I have previously written about God’s comfort and compassion, see the
link and other quotes there:
<br><a class="link2" href="06062023.html">06062023.html</a></p>
<p>For more on suffering in general, see the following links:
<br><a class="link2" href="14042023.html">14042023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="14042023.html">14042023.html</a><br>
<br><a class="link2" href="15072023.html">15072023.html</a></p>
<p>In particular, the last link above says more about why people who are
faithful to God suffer.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will now focus on the fact that common suffering and
enduring it, as well as common comfort and consolation, bring people
closer together and make them even more common.</p>
<p>And also on what is implied in verse 5. Christ has compassion for the
faithful, and in their suffering His suffering is multiplied. But when
the faithful think of Christ, His compassion and love give them comfort,
a spiritual comfort that comes from the Holy Spirit, the Comforter.
Therefore, Christ’s compassion for the faithful gives them comfort,
consolation, and encouragement. The mere mention of it, the memory of
it, is already a certain comfort, but there is also an important meaning
here in that it additionally moves the Holy Spirit to comfort people. We
can say that Christ has compassion for the faithful, and this comforts
them, but the Holy Spirit also comforts the faithful so that He can also
comfort Jesus Christ with them.</p>
<p>I would like to say more about verse 6. Why are the sufferings of the
apostles (saints in general) for the comfort of the faithful (to a
certain extent)? Because the apostles and saints in their sufferings are
examples of virtues that encourage and comfort the faithful in their
suffering, if they are faithful and loving. God’s comfort, God’s
encouragement in the Holy Spirit, is greater than suffering and
compassion. That is why the faithful remember the examples of the
suffering of the saints, because they are more comforting and
encouraging than the sadness of suffering.</p>
<p>Why the comfort of the apostles (saints) is for the comfort of the
faithful is easier to understand, because it is a great comfort and
encouragement to rejoice together.</p>

<p><reading>(Matthew XXI, 43-46) </reading>
</p>
<p>The reading of the parable of the criminal
winemakers, which is read at another time, is omitted here. This parable
depicts the depth of the fall of those who rejected Jesus, and today we
read the conclusion  &ndash; that Jesus, being Lord, will not remain
despised.</p>
<p>See about the previous parable:

<p>The quote about the cornerstone is found in Isaiah XXVIII, 16 and
Psalm CXVIII, 22. I previously wrote about the context of the prophecy
in Isaiah:
<br><a class="link2" href="23032023.html">23032023.html</a></p>
<p>Those who plotted evil against Jesus were afraid of the people, so
they acted in secret to some extent.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <q>other people</q> here are the former
Gentiles who would become Christians.</p>

II, 5-11; Luke X, 38-42, XI, 27-28) For more information about this
