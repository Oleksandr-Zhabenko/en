it is written that the use of prepositions has important significance for the correct understanding of important and topical questions, particularly the question of power, I am writing comments regarding the use of precisely these prepositions. As advice regarding reading what is written — one can read the verse in translation or/and original (whoever has such possibility), and then the corresponding comment regarding prepositions here. Then it is necessary to understand which part of the verse the comment concerns, and also to consider what essential for understanding it affirms — or more rarely — denies. Such thoughtful reading helps to deepen understanding and protects from the mentioned mistakes.

<reading>(1 Corinthians X, 23-28) </reading><br>
1 Corinthians X, 25 — &#39;ἐν μακέλλῳ&#39; — &#39;en makello&#39; - <q>in the shambles</q>. Where.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul teaches the correct attitude to food, and to conscience — one&#39;s own and of those around.
</p>
<p>
I will add further that <q>to seek one&#39;s own</q> — here is a synonym of being closed and focused on oneself.
</p>
<p>
One can also say that the Apostle Paul teaches a wise attitude to all creation.
</p>
<p>
If a person will think: <q>That and that is permissible for me, then why not try?</q>, — then they can easily substitute the need, that which is truly necessary for them, for their salvation, for eternal life (and often also temporal), that which is truly necessary in the same sense also for other people, with <q>apparent possibility and freedom</q>. The Apostle teaches to seek that which is truly necessary.
</p>
<p>

<reading>(Luke XXI, 8-9, 25-27, 33-36) </reading><br>
Luke XXI, 25 — &#39;ἐν ἡλίῳ καὶ σελήνῃ καὶ ἄστροις&#39; — &#39;en helio kai selene kai astrois&#39; - <q>in the sun, and moon, and stars; with the sun, and moon, and stars</q>. Here is a certain difficulty for correct understanding. The listeners of Jesus did not know the peculiarities of the structure of the Universe. Much is not known also by present people. But the Lord as All-knowing could use concepts which exceed even the understanding of future generations. Therefore although the simple understanding consists in the fact that <q>on the sun, moon and stars</q> as objects of observation on the Earth, in the sky, but may also mean also regarding the internal structure, construction, functioning of the luminaries, much of which becomes known during recent decades. One can say that those signs will be given through them, the heavenly luminaries will <q>signal</q>. &#39;ἐν ἀπορίᾳ ἤχους θαλάσσης καὶ σάλου&#39; - &#39;en aporia ekhous thalasses kai salou&#39; - <q>in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves</q>. That is, on open water bodies. Possible indication of tsunami (which there were not in Israel).
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 26 — &#39;ἀπὸ φόβου καὶ προσδοκίας τῶν ἐπερχομένων τῇ οἰκουμένῃ&#39; — &#39;apo phobou kai prosdokias ton eperkhomenon te oikoumene&#39; - <q>from fear and expectation of that which is coming upon the whole world</q>. The preposition &#39;apo&#39; indicates that in reality the news of the approach of the end of the world is not catastrophic, but presupposes in reality the good news about the Kingdom of God and the Coming of Christ in glory. The fear of the end of the world is incorrect, substantially mistaken.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 27 — &#39;ἐν νεφέλῃ&#39; — &#39;en nephele&#39; - <q>in a cloud; with a cloud</q>. That is, the movement of Christ will be accompanied by a cloud.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 34 — &#39;ἐν κραιπάλῃ καὶ μέθῃ καὶ μερίμναις βιωτικαῖς&#39; — &#39;en kraipale kai methe kai merimnais biotikais&#39; - <q>in carousing, and drunkenness, and cares of life (biological); with carousing, and drunkenness, and cares of life (biological)</q>. So that the sinful and that which does not lead to God would not burden people.
</p>
<p>
Luke XXI, 36 — &#39;ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ&#39; — &#39;en panti kairo&#39; - <q>at every season</q>. That is, at each important, meaning-forming change or event.
</p>
<p>
Short excerpts from the words of Jesus about the approach of the Second Coming. About the fact that the Second Coming will be unexpected, it is well written at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05022026.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/commentaries/05022026.html</a>
</p>
<p>
In general the reading is called to <q>awaken</q> a person from the feeling of self-confidence, from the state of self-reliance, from the desire to live <q>without God</q>.
</p>
<p>
<q>… and to stand before the Son of Man</q> — that is, to be established, to stand firmly.
