<p>There were two readings today, one of which was in honour of the righteous Simeon the God-accepter and Anna, the prophetess.</p>

<p><reading>(1 John IV, 20  - endash V, 21) </reading>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The completion of the 1st epistle of the Apostle John the Theologian was read from the daily Apostle. Several very meaningful parts, here just my brief comments.</p>
<p>1) (1 John IV, 20-21)</p>
<p>Often people think that good impressions are more important in love than being able to act well for someone. It seems to them that it is simpler (easier) to love God (Whom they have an idea of as a Good God and He is Good indeed though His real Kindness and Righteousness can significantly differ from what people think of them â€” added 09:58 PM EET 2023-02-16) than to love their neighbours in one way or another, the people whom they can really do good. John says that it is actually the opposite. True love is possible even when a person does not make a pleasant impression, but the true love cannot give birth to bad actions. Actions are therefore more important. In the end, the question comes down to what is more important in love â€” thoughts or actions. John says that actions. It is possible to argue that Christ (God) takes upon Himself what we do to people, but even in this sense, the importance of a person does not disappear, but on the contrary, it becomes even more obvious. Because it's one thing when someone does something <q>just</q> to a person, but it's another when a person realizes that he's (she's) not doing something <q>just</q> to a person, but also to Christ. The importance of <q>just</q> a person does not decrease, but becomes more obvious.</p>
<p>2) (1 John V, 1-5)</p>
<p>About what power faith in Christ and life according to faith and commandments give to Christians. To paraphrase, faith in Christ enables people to fulfill His commandments, thus manifesting and perfecting in love. God's commandments are not difficult  - endash not burdensome for a person who resolutely and unequivocally fulfills them. This testifies to their origin from the Creator of human. On this occasion, there is a short prayer: <q>Jesus, grant me with all my heart to feel the lightness of Your burden.</q></p>
<p>3) (1 John V, 6-13)</p>
<p>About Christian courage  - endash believing, trusting and entrusting oneself completely to Jesus Christ. Some people are afraid to believe, giving various (actually wrong) reasons. John encourages the faithful on their way to Christ with a personal address. I note that part of two verses 7-8 is missing in some ancient texts of the epistle, so many researchers consider it a possible insertion by John's disciples.</p>
<p>4) (1 John V, 14-15)</p>
<p>The word <q>listen</q>, like many key words in the Scripture, has several meanings, is ambiguous (compare, for example, with the words <q>faith, believe</q>), here it is about <q>will take what he heard into action</q> (an analogy with a public servant who begins to implement some decision  - endash but before this decision begins to be implemented, significant work can be done on its preparation and adoption). God does what we ask according to what He wants to do, moreover, He Himself makes us want to ask Him for it. There is more about it in the work <q>On the power of human</q> at the link:</p>
<p><br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/PowerOfHuman.html</a><br></p>
<p>5) (1 John V, 16-17)</p>
<p>About <q>not mortal</q> sins (mistakes that do not destroy communion with God, but harm it) and prayer. Such mistakes cannot be neglected, but they should not <q>take away</q> the joy of life in Christ. In this case, the best manifestation of attention towards them is sincere prayer.</p>
<p>6) (end of the epistle)</p>
<p>The conclusion, short theses, and the final caveat, i.e. the <q>gist</q> of the message and the key task for the writing.</p>

<p><reading>(Mark XV, 1-15) </reading>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the daily Gospel, we read about the final judgement of Jesus by Pontius Pilate. We have more details from the other Gospels. A very meaningful place. In general, there is a good essay about the judgement by Pontius Pilate at the link:</p>
<p><br><a class="link2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Power.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/Power.html</a><br></p>
<p>Mark emphasizes prudence (as a strong trait), but at the same time Pilate's pliability and dependence (as a real weakness). The latter is used by Jews.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!</p>
