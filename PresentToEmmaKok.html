<h1>
How do people perceive rhythm in music?
</h1>
<p>
This is a very interesting question.
</p>
<p>
Let's read the lyrics of a beautiful song. The composer, if there is a lyric, adds musical colours to the text and its rhythm &mdash; in particular, harmony and rhythm. The musical rhythm does not follow the rhythm of the text exactly, but it adds richness to it.
</p>
<p>
A musical rhythm is not completely unpredictable. The next beat, the next sound in a musical series cannot occur at a completely arbitrary moment in time. In particular, this is greatly facilitated by a discrete set of note and pause durations, which are most often powers of two &mdash; whole notes, half notes, fourth notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., or more varied durations, such as triplets, quintoles, septoles, etc. This leads to a certain orderliness of the moments of new sound formation, which makes the music more orderly rather than chaotic in the time dimension.
</p>
<p>
The listener to a certain extent expects sound at certain moments. And then there is a certain interaction between expectation and music. Expectations are ahead of the music, but they are not always correct. 
</p>
<p>
If the rhythm of the text is very noticeable and recognisable, then most often the musical rhythm should add unpredictability, variety, and surprise. And vice versa, if the words and text have a less distinct rhythm, then the musical rhythm should add rhythmicity, enhance it, and make it more predictable.
</p>
<p>
If this rule is not followed, then the character of the piece becomes more rhythmically special and noticeable precisely because of the rhythm, and the rhythm or its weakness attracts more attention. This may be necessary or distracting, it may be in line with the intention, but it may also violate it.
</p>
<p>
This is not an absolute rule, but rather a tradition and a general convention in contemporary music in a broad sense, including classical works. It also suggests that in works where it is easier to create a linguistically discernible rhythm, the music will often not have the same clear rhythm, but rather a more variable one, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
It also depends to a large extent on the genre, for example, dance music has a strengthened rhythm, but within the same composition it can be more noticeable between parts.
</p>
<p>
There are also fluctuations in each piece, i.e. deviations from the <q>average</q> value over a certain period of time.
</p>
<p>
That's why the rhythm seems to be scattered in handfuls throughout the piece, forming <q>clusters and sparse</q>.
</p>
<p>
This is during the development of the melody.
</p>
<p>
In other parts of the piece, there may be a change in this pattern.
</p>
<p>
But if the piece is special, this approach is often not followed&hellip;
</p>
<p>
The rhythm may also partially resemble a fractal structure with several layers.
</p>
<p>
This is what a rhythm looks like when you don't understand why it is like that&hellip; And when you understand why, then it doesn't look like this&hellip; it just is.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we ask the Holy Spirit, Who fills creation with rhythms, to give a good rhythm to everything.<br>
