				<h2>
About the true and dimly cognition
				</h2>
				<p>
The Apostle Paul said: <q>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</q> (1 Corinthians XIII, 12) (mirrors of that time were made using a different technology, they showed everything very roughly, dimly, unclearly, which is sometimes conveyed in different translations with different phrases). So, there is knowing by guesswork and there is knowing the Truth face to face. Truth comes from God, Who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Only He reveals it.
</p>

<p>Therefore, the saints who have attained deification know the Truth, cognise it, not guessingly, but truly. Thus, when something from the Lord is revealed to a prophet or to someone, he or she knows what he or she is talking about, even if only partially, but correctly, indisputably, and truly. All other knowledge is like a guesswork, because it comes from reflection, research, feelings, tests, etc. That is why extrasensory people cannot know and speak the truth, because they are looking for it in a guessing manner, and they may or may not be able to guess. Ask any of them: <q>Is there God?</q>, and they will say at most that they believe in Him, but they will not be able to say that they have cognised Him. Therefore, the words of soothsayers and others cannot be called truth, even if they sometimes coincide with the order of things and events&hellip; For they are not true, but guessing, perhaps skilful, but not true. Extrasensory people can <q>guess</q> something, but their knowledge is not true, although it may be similar to the truth. There is a significant difference between true knowledge (which is from God) and all other knowledge - dim and guessed&hellip;

<p>I quote with a clarification:
<a class="links" href="http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/1331505.html#comment1356110" rel="nofollow">http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/1331505.html#comment1356110</a>
<q>The text I have cited (which reflects,
though certainly not completely, the approach of Scripture to the problem of knowledge) is important
because it suggests that in some ways scientific, philosophical and everyday knowledge are not much
different from faith. The former are all mostly guessing, not true. And if they are true, they are
from God, skilful, correct, accurate, effective, sober, etc.) in foresight: </q>Be wise as serpents and
innocent as children,<q> says the Lord. I did not give the division of knowledge further, because the
question is the value of knowledge as such: Here the Scriptures clearly distinguish between true,
</q>face-to-face<q> knowledge and knowledge from guessing. We can liken human cognition (maybe it is
better to say thinking, reason, logic, but then it is more difficult to talk about the sensual
cognitive powers of the soul - imagination, etc.) to Adam, true cognition in value to God, and
guessing cognition to Eve - the wife and helper. Well, </q>it is not good for man to be alone<q>&hellip; The
Lord blesses scientific cognition if it does not contradict the first. The Lord said: </q>fill the
earth&hellip;<q> and there is science for this. The only problem is to disobey the tempter.</q><br>
(end of quotation)
</p>
<p>
So the Lord revealed to me more deeply through one person, one girl, that <q>God created human beings in His own image, in the image of God created He them, male and female</q> - and therefore it would be more correct not to separate them - in a sense, opposing Eve and God, but human cognition is similar to husband and wife - Adam and Eve - and as the Lord says: <q>Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave (literally: </q>cleave, glue<q>) to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh,</q> and <q>what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> Therefore, I repent of my mistake - no, Adam and Eve together can be likened to human cognition - with their difference&hellip;
