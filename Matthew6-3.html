<p><q>And when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing</q> (Matthew VI, 3)</p>
<p>Continuing with the subject of "How the Lord wants us to overcome temptations", let's look at why the Lord uses the image of hands in such a strange way. Among all the paired parts of the body, the hands can act most independently (in the vast majority of people), freely, this ability is called coordination of movements. A person can do one thing with one hand and another (up to a certain limit) with the other, but for other paired body organs, this ability can be problematic or much more difficult, requiring time to develop and form skills. You can learn to do completely different things with your feet, for example, but it is much more difficult than with your hands. The same goes for eyes, ears, lungs, etc. This is the first thing. And secondly, there are other parts of the body between the hands that can help coordinate movements. In particular, the chest, spine, head, neck, etc. So, the first conclusion is that a person can act quite independently of each other with their hands through the mediation of the body and good coordination of movements.

</p>
<p>In order to emphasise secrecy in the verses, the Lord says "let it not know". A reasonable question arises: should the right hand know and does it know that it is giving alms? Yes, it knows, because otherwise it could not do anything, having lost the ability to move in a controlled manner, being paralysed or lifeless. It needs to know, too, so that it can coordinate its movements and eventually do the alms itself. After all, it has to know that it is doing alms! If we now transfer the image to a human being, we see that the Lord is saying that one must give alms consciously, that one gives alms (and not sin, for example), one must know that one is giving alms, one must be conscious of it. Otherwise, they will not be able to act reasonably. At the same time, it is necessary to coordinate actions, thoughts, desires, etc. so that this awareness does not turn into the sin of vanity, so that a person does not begin to exalt themselves, so that they do not become fascinated by things and objects extraneous to almsgiving itself, in particular, by the awareness of greatness, glory and honour. Moreover, not only should it not turn into sin, but it should be kept secret so that a person does not even begin to take the path of sin, let alone move along it. This is for the Lord, not for sin. Glory be to God for everything.</p>
