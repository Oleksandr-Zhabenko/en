Glory be to Jesus Christ!<br>

"Stones will scream" <br>
â€” what God has truly ordained and does, <br>
then, even if people don't want to, <br>
will be accomplished by the power of God, <br>
superb to the laws of nature. <br>
<br>
But God wants to "humanize" His will,<br>
not that it was a miracle, <br>
and so that people "were a miracle", <br>
and it is better to say â€” that their lives,<br>
even if they are not recognized <br>
and confessed as a miracle, but were<br>
by the exercise of God's will and <br>
a testimony of His love.<br>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!
