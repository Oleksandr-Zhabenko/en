<h2>The Sacrifice of Prophet Elijah as a Prefiguration of Christ's Coming</h2> <div> 
<p> <q>30 And Elijah said to all the people: Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. He restored the destroyed altar of the Lord. 31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Lord said thus: Israel shall be thy name. 32 And he built from this stone an altar in the Lord's Name, and made around the altar a trench, with capacity of two measures of grain, 33 and laid wood, and cut the bullock, and laid it on the wood, 34 and said: Fill four buckets of water and pour on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood. Then said: repeat. And they repeated. And said: Do this a third time. And they did it a third time, 35 and water poured around the altar, and the trench was filled with water. 36 And it came to pass, when he offered the evening sacrifice, prophet Elijah approached and said: Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel! Let them know on this day that Thou art the one God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and have done all according to Thy word. 37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me! Let this people know that Thou, Lord, art God, and Thou wilt turn their heart to Thee. 38 And the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the fine particles of earth, and absorbed the water that was in the trench. 39 When all the people saw this, they fell on their faces and said: The Lord is God, the Lord is God!</q> (1 Kings XVIII, 30-39). </p>

<p> The Church of Christ has testified (in tradition, although written sources are unknown to me) that here we see a prefiguration of it and the Sacraments. Not in vain did Moses and Elijah appear to Christ on Tabor, as great among the prophets. In Elijah's sacrifice there is a clear prefiguration. Behold: the altar <q>destroyed</q>, which <q>Elijah restored</q>, according to the number of twelve tribes of Israel — the same as the prophecy about <q>restoration of the destroyed tabernacle</q> in Christ's Coming, and twelve stones — prefiguration of the Twelve Apostles. And the True Lord God is known through sacrifice — therefore Christ is known as God, but also as Man, for Elijah acts by God's will, therefore he is an image of Christ. But see, Elijah restored not the tabernacle, but the altar, and the altar was also at the tabernacle, since it is said: <q>I will restore the destroyed tabernacle</q>, — says the Lord, the Master Himself will restore, and not His faithful servant Elijah or anyone else. Elijah says: <q>The true God is He who will answer with fire</q>. And Christ is the true God, since He sent the Fire of the Spirit from heaven from the Father to the Apostles on the Day of Pentecost. And see: God brings sacrifice to Himself, so also Christ brings Himself as sacrifice and accepts it together with the Father and Spirit. And the sacrifice is poured with water thrice — this is prefiguration of Baptism in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And that fire from heaven consumed the burnt offering — this is prefiguration of divinisation of the body of Christ, Who became incarnate, in Whom there is no place for sin, and prefiguration of Communion and the Church, and that then it consumed the wood — prefiguration of the power of the Precious Life-giving Cross of the Lord, <q>in which I will boast</q>, — says Apostle Paul, and that then it consumed the stones — this is prefiguration of Christ's descent into hell to the Forefathers, and prefiguration of the Spirit's Descent upon the Apostles, and that it consumed the fine particles of earth — prefiguration of the fact that <q>death is swallowed up in victory</q>, and the dead rose with Christ, and that it consumed the water too — prefiguration of sanctification of the entire world and elements. This is all also prefiguration of the Second Glorious Coming of Christ. And through the Body of Christ — the Church, God saves the world — so also through sacrifice fire burns everything. Therefore when the Lord comes again, all nations will know and will say: The Lord is God, Christ is God! — to the glory of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. </p>

<p>The expanded quote from the topic I published on the Portal bogoslov.ru as a comment. See: The topic of penetration of fire into iron and its use in the context of describing divinisation of man in the patristic tradition (written in Russian). The article was written by Biryukov D. S., but the comment from this topic also fits here.</p> </div></div>
