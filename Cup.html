<h1>Was Christ arguing during His prayer about the cup in the Gethsemane?
</h1>
<ul class="paragraph-ul">
	<li>The prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane is described by all
synoptic evangelists. This is the event after
the Last Supper before His detention and
convulsions, and then suffering, crucifixion, death,
by burial and resurrection. In the Gospels it is
verses: Matthew XXVI, 36-46; Mark XIV, 32-42;
Luke XXII, 31-34. Many people have a question:
what the plea and behavior of Christ means.
</li>
	<li>Christ did not doubt in the Gethsemane, nor did He
Argued. But it is unusual for a person to desire
suffering and death, this is what is clearly manifested
in His prayer. However, He knows what will happen, and
it strengthens Him as a human being.
</li>
	<li>We can also say that Christ was not
fanatical.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is the problem?
</h1>
<ul class="paragraph-ul">
	<li>But no matter how much you think about a happy future, about victory, etc., the desire to suffer
still does not arise, as well as the desire to die. Therefore, it is wrong to think that Christ, as
a person, simply realized what would happen after suffering and death and therefore was able to
master his feelings and desires. No, it is not.
</li>
	<li>It was the agreement with God's will for His sacrifice that was necessary for the salvation of
mankind. Otherwise, the human would remain separated and dissentered with God.
Think of the child. The example is taken from the book "Negotiate always", but it is so vital. So,
imagine that your child (if there is, and if not, then imagine that he / she is) does not like cabbage,
namely, it needs to be eaten so that the child is healthy. You say, "Okay, eat cabbage first, and
then your favorite ice cream." The child is ready to eat ice cream&hellip; BUT&hellip; he / she doesn't want to eat
cabbage. And whatever options you come up with if he / she doesn't like cabbage&hellip; You probably
understood.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>How did He do it?
</h1>
<ul class="paragraph-ul">
	<li>That's actually about the unwillingness to suffer and die in question. About the desire to live
and rejoice.
</li>
	<li>The human mind of Christ knew what would happen because it was connected hypostasically with the
mind of God. Therefore, Christ suffered wisely, He knew of all the consequences and events in that
matter. It was a conscious decision. So, there was no resistance from the mind. And from the side of
the will. Christ's human will is obedient to God's will. Notice that God won as a human not just by
awareness and knowledge of the coming victory (although it has meaning for this, actually for the
mind of Christ), but also by obedience, trust, and communion with the Father and the Spirit.
</li>
<li>Obedience. A human is able to perceive someone's will as his / her own and obey it. This ability to
share, to participate in someone's will is called consent, and in other cases obedience, 
and the like. The ability of someone's will to make their own through obedience, through participation.
</li>
	<li>Trust. To prevent this from causing resistance, trust is required. Christ, as a human, 
trusts Himself entirely as God, as well as to the Father and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, His obedience as a
human is free.
</li>
	<li>Communion (association). Therefore, Christ prays, for this communion with the Father and the Spirit 
(as also the association with the sent Angel, as in Luke) strengthens Him. This communion,
association, this participation in God's will adores
the human will, makes it capable of voluntarily accepting suffering and death. That's actually the
meaning of praying. Not in struggle or resistance, but in participation, communion and obedience
in trust.</li>
</ul>
