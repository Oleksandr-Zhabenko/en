<h1>Commentary on the Gospel of Luke IX, 50 and Mark IX, 40.</h1>

<p class="paragraph">About the "man who did not go with them", I wrote earlier, there is a good explanation at the link: 
<a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10215048127796137&id=1818652193">here.</a></p>

<p class="paragraph">The Lord says that "he who is not for you is against you", "he who does not gather scatters", "he who is not against us is for us" (Luke IX, 49-50, Mark IX, 38-41, Matthew XII, 30, etc.). 
He is talking about Himself, generally speaking, from which such an opinion follows that one cannot be neutral about Christ Himself. This thought is known, that is, we can never be in the middle, for example, between God and the devil or we can not be between the Kingdom of God and hell, there is no intermediate, middle state, in fact, in reality we will never be in the middle. 
There is a certain temporary indeterminate state -- the present time, not yet determined, but still it is not final. Regarding Christ, we cannot be in the middle, "neutral", in terms of being with Him or against Him, being for Christ or against Him. 
If the apostles are with Christ, the Church is with Christ in this context, then these words can be applied to them. It is impossible to be neutral about the Church in this sense. 
Christ is at the center of the universe, and everything has its meaning and significance in relation to Him, relative to Him, and there is nothing that has meaning without Him. 
Everything else that is not directly with Christ in this context is not at the center of the universe, and in relation to it we can be neutral, we can take some intermediate position.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">When it comes to the relationship between the Church and the surrounding world, which does not concern the Church itself, i.e. outside the Church, then here the apostles are included in these words of Christ as His representatives, that is actually these words apply to them, they are at the center of the world structure, 
and you cannot also be neutral in respect with them, you cannot be in the middle, that is (finally) just as you cannot serve two masters, also in another place - a person will decide, love someone and will serve this one - God or mammon. In such a context, a person (or people, or society) cannot be in the middle.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">On the other hand, if it is a question of relations between Churches, which, for example, mutually recognize the Sacraments or have a need for greater unity, then they cannot consider each other or themselves in the context that "we are at the center of the universe", because they are not in this context alone relative to each other in the center of the universe.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">I will stop at the word "He who is not against you is FOR you" (Luke IX, 50). "for" is the Greek "hyper" (υπερ), which with the genitive case comes from "over", "above", can also mean a reason, "for what". That is, these words can also be understood as "(a field for agricultural work, preaching, activity) for you" or also: "your actions are for the purpose of bringing them to the knowledge of the truth", "that is why you are sent to preach to those who do not mind you".
</p>
<p class="paragraph">I will also add that the same words can be understood in another way - "who is not against you, in that I act above what I act in you" ("over" is not "more", 
but as an excess, similar to the well-known "crumbs" ). And in another way - "those who are not against you can often act "on your behalf", that is, their good will serve for the spread of faith, and their quantity - for the mass of faith." 
In all cases, we see the multifacetedness of God's providence and care for the faithful and everyone else. </p>
<h2>About the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Colossians I, 18-29</h2>
<p class="paragraph">A solemn continuation of Paul's theological confession of faith in Christ as the Head of the Church and the First in everything. 
Along with the first chapter of the Gospel of John, this is one of the most eloquent testimonies about the God-manship of Jesus Christ. 
It is closely related to the words of the Creed, "[Jesus Christ]... begotten, uncreated, consubstantial with the Father, through whom all things were made." 
"The Firstborn from the dead" is a brief apostolic confession of the Resurrection of the God-man Jesus and the future resurrection and deification of the faithful. 
"begotten" has the same nature as "parents", while "created" has a different nature than "creator". Therefore, these words are both about the God-manship of Jesus and about the union of the faithful with God (deification) through the grace and unity of the Church.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Paul's testimony about apostolic work and suffering for Christ and the faithful. "I supplement the lack of Christ's sufferings" is a literal translation. 
Christ suffered for (instead of) us, therefore the faithful, who suffer with Christ's, "supplement" His (greater and innocent free) sufferings with their other sufferings. 
It is about active activity, work, feat in the patience of Paul, "struggling with His power that works mightily" - more literally (more accurately) it will be - 
"I diligently strive according to His energy (action outwardly), which works outwardly in me in power (power) ". 
Hence, the concept of "God's energy", "God's action in creation", "grace" and "synergy" is basic for theology. 
Paul works diligently with effort and inspiration, but more - God is in him (with power).
</p>
