<p>
The Lord speaks about knowledge in particular: <q>Knock and it will be opened to you, seek and you will find, ask and you will receive, for everyone who asks receives, to everyone who knocks it is opened, and everyone who seeks finds</q>.
</p>
<p>
The general meaning of these words, as we know, is, among other things, the idea that one can only find (know) what the Lord makes possible and accessible to find. After all, if one knocks on a stone, no one opens it and will not open it (although Moses gave the Israelites water from the stone by the power of God), because the Lord did not make it possible for the stone to open. . But they knock on Him, on people, and He says that He opens, and the faithful know that His promise is irrevocable and unshakable.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the general Gospel view of God is that He is known in Christ, through Christ in the Holy Spirit in what He reveals, and this is sufficient in every case. .
</p>
<p>
In addition, the Lord's words suggest that a much more dangerous and important question for knowledge is not the limits of what is revealed, but the incorrect, deceptive and false knowledge. He said: <q>Is there a person among you who, when their son asks for bread, gives him a scorpion? A viper instead of an egg? If you [being wicked] know how to give good gifts to those who ask, how much more will your heavenly Father give the benefits [the Holy Spirit] to those who beg of Him?</q>.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to Thee, our God, glory be to Thee!<br>
