<h1>About Marriage and only one</h1>
<p>
Important thoughts that came to me after reading some interesting reflections (in translation) at the link:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://credo.pro/2025/09/387161">https://credo.pro/2025/09/387161</a>
</p>
<p>
That God appoints something does not contradict human freedom. In particular, the existence of certain circumstances does not contradict human freedom. Each circumstance, in fact, contains something that often does not depend solely on human freedom — ours or someone else’s. Even if, for the most part, these circumstances are determined by people’s actions, people still make use of the environment and other circumstances that do not depend on them directly: the level of development, and so on. Thus there is always something independent of their freedom, and nevertheless people act freely. This does not limit their freedom. See also:<br>
<a target="_blank" class="links2" href="https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html">https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/en/DialogueOnWordsChristFear.html</a>
</p>
<p>
With regard to God, one can say more: God can act as He wills, and in this He is absolutely free. Yet man, being in His likeness, although he cannot act immediately and always as he wishes, can nevertheless act freely. This is, firstly.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, let us look at Adam and Eve. When the Lord created Eve from Adam’s rib (or from his side, if one renders it that way), there is also a reference to the Holy Spirit. The Greek expression «παρὰ τοῦ πατρός» (John  XV, 26) roughly refers to <q>from beside the Father</q>, which could allude to Eve (Genesis I, 26-30, II, 18-25).
</p>
<p>
But returning directly to Adam and Eve. The Lord creates Eve, the woman, according to His design, and then brings her to Adam. It is not Adam or Eve who come to each other of their own accord, but the Lord who brings Eve to Adam. Then Adam says: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man” (Genesis II, 21–24). Thus, Adam acknowledges this, and one may think that this very moment was the establishment of marriage. God blessed human marriage, but at the same time we see the synergy of God and the human being. We also see that it is God who initiates everything, and it is God who unites people in Marriage, as Christ says: “What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder” (Matthew XIX, 5–6). For God brought Eve to Adam, having created her for him — that was God’s beginning. And Adam, for his part, accepted it, realized it, and uttered his words.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we see synergy. And I think the same happens in people’s lives. For the Lord says: “He who is able to accept this, let him accept it”, speaking about marriage. What is meant here is that for many, or at least for some, God may foresee and appoint “their person” — just as it was with Adam and Eve, or with other married couples (let us recall, for example, the story from the Book of Tobit), or in the life of the Mother of God. There are many examples.
</p>
<p>
Primarily this occurs when it is needed not only for those people themselves, but also for others — or for the history of the world, the Church, for the salvation of humankind. But it is possible that God does not always determine a person’s partner in advance, leaving more freedom of choice to the individual. Nevertheless, in any case cooperation between God and man takes place. For it is God who unites, not the person.
</p>
<p>
In marriage, of course, God has united, and therefore the words of Christ have deep meaning. And they have even more meaning when He speaks of adultery. Here, in my view, priester Mr. Michael Rennier forgets something. See::<br>

</p>
<p>
Also, today’s readings from the Apostle in honour of the holy Ancestors of God, Joachim and Anna (Galatians IV, 22–31), which speak of the two sons of Abraham and also of the two Covenants, are directly related to this — if God has appointed someone for someone, this is important for the salvation of many; and if He has granted more freedom, then He has not abandoned them to fate, without care and providence.
