(Luke XXII, 48) — "Judas, do you give out the Son of Man with a kiss?", — the question of God the
Creator to man, which shows that God created kisses for love, closeness (intimacy), special
manifestation of personality, when through the body is also revealed something that is not reduced
only to the body. The kiss is created by God by design as a sign, that is, it always means
something, points to (probably better to translate, indicates) something, but Judas distorted
himself in a way that commits a serious sin by kissing as a sign of his betrayal, a sign of the evil
one. A kiss may point to (indicate, be related to) the body, may point to the soul, may — to the
evil one (as in the case of Judas' kiss), or may — to God. The Lord reveals the depth of Judas' fall
by calling him to repentance through manifestation of his sin (oh, if Judas had really thought about
the words of Christ, he could repent, instead he died in despair afterwards).
