Motivation for learning "The same day Jesus ... taught them much in parables, saying, 'Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: “Behold, a sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them. Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth. But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them. But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”... “Therefore hear the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside. But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.” (Matthew XIII, 1-23).

<p class="paragraph">
If a seed sprouts, it produces a lot of fruit, multiplying at least 30 times, or even 100 times. For example, if a person learns something necessary, "good and vital" (which contributes to a good, prosperous and fulfilling life), then it takes a little time, for example, to hear good science takes... from a few seconds to perhaps an hour or two. The measure of time is rather arbitrary, but it's still about right. But if the person perceives it well and then makes it a part of his or her life, then it will bear numerous fruits in life. The person can even live their whole life, which can be up to 100 years or more, i.e. 876600 hours (if you take away a third of them for sleep, then there are about 584400 hours left). If the probability that the person will use what he or she has learnt within the next hour is at least 2/584400, which is approximately equal to 3.4223*10^(-6), i.e. a little over three millionths, then the two hours spent were well worth it. To be motivated to study... you just need to realise it, maybe even to imagine it clearly.
