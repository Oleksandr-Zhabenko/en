<h1>The memory of St. Gregory the Theologian and the memory of my grandmother Leontina is dedicated.</h1>

<h1>About the soul of human as a stream of God's light (according to Gregory the Theologian).

<p class="paragraph">
Here, it is spoken about the result (created) of the grace of the Holy Spirit (and the whole Trinity).
The image of the stream &ndash; recalls the "streams of living water" (John 7:38), which Christ speaks of in the Gospel
of John, and creation by reason of God's every continued care for him is likened to a jet stream, full
of movement of water, alive movement, "variability" of grace, "grace for grace" (John 1:16), "from one to another grace",
"from glory to glory". In the soul, the manifestation of this mobility and the aliveness of God is most visible,
because the body moves less than the soul.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">It is also about how God revives man, a human being through His breath - the very first life fills
the heart and soul, so you need to love God first with all your heart and with all your soul. About the heart I have
written in the work
